Wall Street also appeared to shake off a post-earnings decline in Nvidia.\\n*****\\n> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 247 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.\\n*****\\n> Nvidia shares were down 4% after posting its latest earnings Wednesday afternoon. In its fiscal second quarter, the AI chipmaker exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines, and issued a rosy current-quarter sales outlook.\\n*****\\n> “Death, taxes, and NVDA beats on earnings are three things you can bank on. Here’s the issue, the size of the beat this time was much smaller than we’ve been seeing. Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters,” wrote Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.\\n*****\\n> “This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season,” Detrick added.\\n*****\\n> That decline was offset by a pop in Salesforce. Shares traded 5% higher after the business software giant beat fiscal second-quarter estimates and raised its full-year profit outlook.\\n*****\\n> Wall Street is coming off a losing session after a slump in Nvidia shares ahead of the company’s earnings results weighed on the major averages. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.12%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. The 30-stock Dow slid about 159 points, or 0.39%.\\n*****\\n> Those moves highlight the growing significance of Nvidia to the broader market. The semiconductor company, which passed the $3 trillion market cap this year to briefly become the world’s most valuable public company, now accounts for roughly 7% of the S&P 500.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/PReNccM.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eTHr6p0.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/e2h2YOd.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/neOYmcB.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/J9Ze5Br.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ELLgoub.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/38uQZdh.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/WCcVUEA.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lRYArSQ.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/srNXvYy.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7k5Uf2c.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sujqy17.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/oGSxR4b.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hU67Dvj.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\\n\\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/stocks-making-biggest-moves-premarket-nvda-crm-crwd-hpq-and-more.html)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> **Nvidia** — The chip designer and artificial intelligence bellwether slipped more than 4% despite surpassing Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom line in its fiscal second quarter.

The national debt was $31 trillion on that day. Today its $35 trillion. One year\\'s debt inflation of 13%. Is this why stuff costs so much?*  \\n  \\nTalking point for Kamala’s proposed tax on unrealized capital gains:\\xa0*“Only the top 1% will pay this tax”.*\\xa0Where have we heard this one before? Oh . . . when the government started the federal income tax in the early 20th century. The rate was going to be 1% on anybody earning $3,000 a year. That would be $100,000 in today\\'s 2024 dollars, in case you’re wondering. Now Kamala promises her new wealth tax (on savings and investments we haven\\'t cashed in yet) will only apply to 1% of us. See links below.  \\n  \\nWho wouldn’t want to pay 0% income tax today, like our grandparents did? Or just 1% tax on their wages over $100,000, lol? Instead, we have a grab bag of dozens of taxes on everybody. And combined federal-state-local income taxes over 50% in lots of places. From tiny acorns mighty oaks can grow.  \\n  \\nAnd despite this huge escalation in taxes, America still managed to accumulate a $35 trillion in government debt. Spending and borrowing money they never collected despite all those taxes. When will the US national debt hit $36 trillion? Not this week, thankfully. But we ARE adding $5 billion a day to the pile. So, sooner rather than later.  \\n  \\nBack to the “unrealized capital gains tax”. It’s unfair to blame this solely on Kamala. Or Biden . . . even though Kamala eagerly took on most of his 2024 presidential campaign platform, including new taxes on everything, everywhere, all at once.  \\n  \\nDemocrats have been talking - for decades - about taxing the savings and investments we still have in the bank. This is their big chance – the 2024 presidential election. The only believable republican campaign position is that the national debt is too high. The democrat response: let\\'s just tax profits you haven\\'t even made yet. Or “unrealized capital gains”, the euphemism they coyly use. Remember – you MUST remember – this new tax will ONLY apply to the top 1%. Just like the federal income tax, when it was rolled out.  \\n  \\nEven if the government – both parties – was miraculously able to keep their promise this one time, and NEVER increase the wealth tax, it’s still an awful idea. The big reveal is below, if you made it this far:  \\n  \\nCapital gains taxes could plummet to zero when the stock market declines. This makes the new tax proposal the RISKIEST one imaginable. Politicians will (theoretically) rake in Trillions and Trillions with the during the fat years. But during the lean years, when the stock market declines, or there’s a recession, there could be nothing. But of course federal spending won’t be dialed back when this tax revenue peters out. Whenever there\\'s a recession, the government always wants to spend even more.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**Why Kamala Harris\\'s approach to capital gains is generating so much controversy (msn.com)**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/why-kamala-harriss-approach-to-capital-gains-is-generating-so-much-controversy/ar-AA1pzZKH?ocid=BingNewsSerp)  \\n  \\n[**Inflation Calculator**](https://www.calculator.net/inflation-calculator.html)', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1f40yz0/who_wouldnt_love_to_pay_taxes_on_money_they/', 'num_comments': 27, 'score': 0, 'upvote_ratio': 0.24, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.5859, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.7141}\n",

Imo, not for long anymore', 'selftext': \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nNow that the NVDA earnings are out, and investors can again look beyond that...\\n\\nThe uranium sector is in a global structural supply deficit, and now Kazakhstan, responsible for \\\\~45% of world production, announced a big cut in the hoped uranium production for 2025 and hinted for additional cuts for 2026 and beyond.\\n\\nA. There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\\n\\nLet me explain\\n\\na) The gas price represents \\\\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\\n\\nThe uranium price only represents \\\\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\\n\\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\\n\\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\\n\\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\\n\\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\\n\\nB.

Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge.\\n\\nb) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\\n\\nAll the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.\\n\\nc) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\\n\\nImportant to know here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!\\n\\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nKazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\\n\\nAnd before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\\n\\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, a global consultant for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in the world](https://preview.redd.it/apzvdoihwlld1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=066eab0fc9da414317621fb536ca789dd10eb99a)\\n\\n\\n\\n**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world).

Next week we will gradually enter the high season again\\n\\nIn the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.\\n\\nIn the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: I post this now (at the very end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector.\\n\\n**This isn't financial advice.

By examining these variables in a single study, the authors were able to identify relevant patterns and offer recommendations for increasing access.\\n\\nGreater variety: The need for more variety in EV sales is one potential area of improvement. Survey respondents with lower incomes were more likely to prefer a pre-owned sedan, van, or pick-up truck. The authors recommend that manufacturers introduce more diverse EV types and classes, and that policymakers enact measures to strengthen the used EV market.\\nReliable and convenient charging: Survey respondents with lower incomes were more likely to rent their property and live in multi-family homes, where they may be unable to install charging equipment. Study findings highlight key equity concerns in the current model for EV charging, which centers on the home and workplace. To ensure equitable charging, the authors suggest targeted policies such as rebates and modified building codes. They also recommend placing charging stations at grocery stores, commercial districts, and gas stations, where people can charge while completing errands.\"\\n\\nThe article also noted that cheap Electric Bikes and public transport like E buses will help the poor. The EV market has deteriorated recently, with many firms cutting investment in EVs. And cheap Chinese EVs face the threat of high tariffs. So manufacturers should focus on making low cost EVs in forms in demand by lower middle class to lower class available.

I’ll argue it should be a case study in every business school, as it continues to outsmart giants like Nike and Adidas.\\n\\nLululemon has been growing its revenue at an average rate **above 20% annually** for a decade, significantly higher than Nike’s 6%, and the disappointing 3% of Adidas.\\n\\nNot only is Lululemon increasing its market share, but it is significantly more profitable than its competitors.\\n\\n**Last decade's operating margin:**\\n\\nNike: 13%\\n\\nAdidas: 7%\\n\\nLululemon: 20%\\n\\n***How is this possible?***\\n\\n\\n\\n**2.0 Its secret formula - Ignoring the rules**\\n\\nThe big companies out there spend millions on celebrity endorsements. This approach brings exposure quickly but is very expensive.\\n\\n**Nike** has Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Rafael Nadal.\\n\\n**Adidas** has Lionel Messi, David Beckham, and James Harden.\\n\\n**Under Armour** has Dwayne Johnson, Tom Brady, and Steph Curry.\\n\\n\\n\\n**What about Lululemon?** Well, there’s no celebrity.\\n\\nLululemon took a different approach. Instead of paying millions to celebrities, it partners with **micro-influencers**, **yoga teachers**, and **fitness instructors**, who are largely unknown. These people live more ordinary lives and one can easily connect with them.\\n\\nThey’re known as “**brand ambassadors**“ and they get to host Lululemon events. In return for promoting the brand, they get:\\n\\n* Free Lululemon apparel;\\n* Priority access to new products; and\\n* Featured on Lululemon’s social media and website, which generates more traffic for them and helps them build/grow their business and audience.\\n\\nNike spends 9% of its revenue on marketing, Adidas spends 11%, and Lululemon spends less than **5%!**\\n\\nNot only this approach is cheaper, but it also allows for thousands of communities to be formed, that are likely to stay together. The outcome is clear: **Stronger, deeper, emotional relationships are formed**, that are not purely transactional.\\n\\nThis is the company’s **MOAT** - Creating a cult-like following.\\n\\nIn addition, there are larger outdoor events, 10k runs, sweat games, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3.0 Too Expensive Products - So What?**\\n\\nThe company’s products are **significantly more expensive** than the competition. They capitalized on the increase in demand for athletic, stylish, yet versatile clothing that eventually became known as “**athleisure**“.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that the products come with exceptional quality, thanks to a combination of innovative fabrics and superior design. In addition, there is free hemming that comes with a Lululemon membership. This service ensures that the product purchased fits the customer.\\n\\nCombining all of this, with the community aspect above, allows the company to charge a premium price for its products.\\n\\nThe two main competitors in the U.S. are now **Alo Yoga** and **Vuori** and there are plenty of copycats. This is being perceived as the biggest risk, yet, the company continues to grow and deliver.\\n\\n**Is the demand for its products going to decrease?**\\n\\nHistory has taught us that there will be demand for premium brands, especially in the fashion industry. From Dior and Louis Vuitton to Rolex and Balenciaga, all of them face copycats. Yet, they are still around and doing well.\\n\\nFor that reason, I do believe Lululemon will continue to grow in the years to come, especially given the fact that the company’s international expansion has just started (\\\\~80% of the revenue comes from the Americas).\\n\\nIn addition, the younger generations have a more favorable view of Lululemon. The company will only benefit from this trend over time.\\n\\n  \\n**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**\\n\\nOver the last twelve months, the company's revenue was almost $10b, with an operating margin of 22%.\\n\\nAs mentioned at the very beginning, the company’s margins are significantly above its competitors. There are two main reasons for that:\\n\\n1. **Advertising** - which was already covered above\\n2. **Selling directly to consumers** - Over 90**%** of all the sales are online, or through the company-operated stores. This means in most cases, there is **no 3rd party in between collecting a fee**.\\n\\nAs the company is profitable and generates lots of free cash flow, it is worth having a look at the other side of the equation. Where does the cash go?\\n\\n1. **Capex** - In order to grow, the company has to reinvest in opening new stores.\\n2. **Share buybacks** - The number of shares outstanding is down \\\\~10% over the last decade.\\n\\n  \\n**5.0 Past Mistakes**\\n\\nBefore I move to the topic of valuation, two management decisions can be labeled as mistakes:\\n\\n1. In June 2020, Lululemon acquired Mirror for \\\\~$500m. Fast forward to Q4-2022, and the business has now almost been entirely written off. The in-house fitness company that created an interactive workout platform featuring live and on-demand classes did not do as well as expected post the pandemic.\\n2. The share price of the company went up significantly on a few occasions, and the management decided to continue buying back shares. I do think above a certain point, share buybacks destroy shareholders’ value, and this point has been crossed way too many times.\\n\\n  \\n**6.0 Valuation**\\n\\nMy assumptions are as follows:\\n\\n**Revenue**: To double over the next decade (\\\\~7% annualized growth)\\n\\n**Operating margin:** To remain at the current level of 22%.\\n\\nBased on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $33.6b **($269/share)**, not that far from today’s share price of $259.\\n\\nHere’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:\\n\\n|Revenue / Operating margin|20%|22%|24%|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|75% ($17.5b)|$217|$242|$266|\\n|102% ($20.2b)|$241|$269|$297|\\n|125% ($22.5b)|$263|$294|$325|\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.\", 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f4fac3/deep_dive_into_lululemon_outsmarting_nike_and/', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 18, 'upvote_ratio': 0.72, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.0, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.9988}\n",
