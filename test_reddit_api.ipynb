Their total capex for 2023 is $55.3B combined. Which means that they spent 16.2% of their total Capex spending in 2023 on NVDA chips alone. So I looked at their Capex for this last quarter, which is $22.04B combined, up from $15.17B combined in Q2 2023 (up 45% YoY). The article also states that these 2 along with AMZN, and GOOGL make up a little less than 40% of all NVDA chip sales in 2023. So, I looked at their numbers as well. AMZN and GOOGL in Q2-2024 spent $30.80B on Capex, up from $18.33B in Q2 2023 (up 68% YoY). If we use the 16.2% of their capex rule on NVDA from 2023 then combined the 4 companies spent $8.56B in Q2 alone this quarter on NVDA chips.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw6ulcq1nhhd1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5f045bd5d7c8d10238567c37837319ed8ca71e3\\n\\nBut I think with such a huge increase YoY on Capex spending that the total % spent of capex on NVDA chips is closer to 30% at least. Which would mean they spent $15.82B on NVDA chips last quarter. Looking at NVDA’s Q1 earnings they reported $22.5B in datacenter chip sales Q1. Meaning potentially 40% of their customer base has already purchased 75% of their total revenue in chip sales from Q1 2024 in Q2 2024. NVDA in their first quarter presentation is expecting $28.0B in total revenue for Q2 2024, which is 7.52% higher than what they reported in Q1 ($26.04B). Yet their biggest customers are reporting an avg increase in Capex spending of 19.33% from Q1 to Q2 in 2024. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezyilod4ohhd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0db445fd539a08346afa26a840fd2253e9e0140\\n\\nI think this is a no brainer beat of the predicted $28B in revenue. Yet impacts to profit margins, chip shortages, and guidance changes of 2025 that are unknown mean the price action can't be accurately predicted. Invest at your own risk. I would love to hear others opinions on this upcoming earnings for NVDA and what they think could be reported.\"\n",

A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession.\\n\\nYesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%.\\n\\nNvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%.\\n\\nHowever, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%! This echoes Goldman Sachs' recent increase in the U.S. recession probability, from 15% to 25%⬆️.\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/weekly-jobless-claims-fall-to-233000-less-than-expected-in-a-positive-sign-for-labor-market.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/weekly-jobless-claims-fall-to-233000-less-than-expected-in-a-positive-sign-for-labor-market.html)\"\n",

Just say “oh I totally messed up these numbers. We actually are at 14% profit not 11%. Doug the assistant made a typo when handing me the GAAP numbers. Not to worry we laid him off.

The app's adaptability has led to its adoption by diverse communities, from hobbyist clubs to professional networks. This evolution mirrors a broader societal shift towards digital connection, making Discord a symbol of the contemporary way we come together, collaborate, and share online. The company is going to IPO sometime this year or next, is anyone watching the stock? Who here plans on buying in?\\n\\nWhen RDDT IPO'd, I jumped in and still holding. I wanted to do a little write up to put in my thoughts on discord and see what people are think. See, I think Discord is great because of its easy-to-use interface and structured approach with servers and channels. It’s not just another messaging app—Discord’s voice channels offer a real-time, immersive way to connect, which has been a game-changer for many users.\\n\\nTo keep the platform growing, Discord rolled out Nitro, a subscription service that offers perks like higher file upload limits and better streaming quality. Nitro's success shows that Discord can successfully monetize its platform, fueling speculation about a potential IPO. However, as of now, there’s no set date for Discord to go public, so buying Discord stock isn’t an option yet. But who knows—2024 could be the year we see Discord make its market debut.\\n\\nI know what you guys are probably wondering if you're still reading up until this point. You're wondering what an IPO might mean for the platform’s future and more importantly: whether it’s a good investment opportunity. Well, if Discord does go public, it could give the company the financial boost it needs to keep innovating and expanding. For investors (like us), it’s a chance to buy into what’s been a pretty impressive tech success story.\\n\\nI believe the key to discord's value is in it's loyal and diverse community. This app essentially has become a go-to platform for building online communities. If Discord does hit the stock market, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a lot of support from its massive user base. Many users becoming investors. But I also get why some might be cautious about jumping in on day one.\\n\\nAn IPO is exciting, but it’s not without its challenges. Discord will need to keep investors happy while staying true to the user-friendly, community-focused vibe that’s made it so popular. How they manage that will be key to their long-term success.\\n\\nFor those of us who use Discord, an IPO could bring both good and bad changes. On the plus side, more funding could lead to better features and a stronger platform. But we might also see shifts in how the company operates as it adjusts to the pressures of being publicly traded. It’s definitely something to keep an eye on if and when Discord makes its market debut.\\n\\nSo I have to ask, has anybody else been reading up Discord's IPO? Is there anyone here who plans on grabbing shares?\"\n",

      "submission.selftext = 'Lady and gentlemen, 2 months ago [I came](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dcghne/american_consumer_credit_is_tapped_out_and_growth/) to you with the most autistic examination of economic data I could muster while only 4 shots in, and ended up drinking my own Kool-aid to the price of a LEAPS put against QQQ at the $480 strike expiring June of 2025. Today, I have an update on the data, the events of the past 2 months, and the position. Please see that topic for a broader explanation of my thesis and reasoning.\\n\\n**TL;DR**: I thought American consumers were defaulting on credit cards as fast as they were spending, and we were headed into a recession within a year.\\n\\n# What does the new data say?\\n\\nThe [G.19](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm) dropped of the 7th with June economic data on the American consumer. Revolving credit is down -1.5% YoY seasonally adjusted, and non-revolving credit is up 3.4%. This seems to confirm that May\\'s increase in revolving credit was a fluke. We can also look at motor vehicle loans and see there was a spike in spending. Since the other part of my \"consumers are tapped out\" thesis was Americans weren\\'t buying cars, what gives? Well two things have happened. First, vehicle interest rates are still quite high, so it\\'s possible that some delinquencies are continuing to pile up interest. Vehicles are generally quick to be repossessed though so take that with a grain of salt and we would expect this to at this point be deflationary. What else is happening is vehicle prices [especially on the used market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02) are starting to fall back to natural levels. This is bringing their prices more in line with actual demand, which is healthy. However it is also deflationary and thus points to a weakened consumer vs. previous market expectations, as current demand cannot sustain the high prices. The used car market is a canary in the consumer demand coal mine, as all discretionary spending will likely follow. The artificially inflated prices we have seen the past few years will begin to fall off a cliff as consumers are forced to make more and more drastic cuts to their spending in order to keep their heads above water.\\n\\nThis sentiment is being echoed by weak guidance by Q2 earnings reports based on consumer spending habits. In my last post I predicted a mid Q2 earnings followed by weakened guidance and that appears to be what we\\'re seeing, as the ETF I primarily trade, QQQ, dropped from over $500 at its high to around $430 within the past 2 months. All the pieces are coming together and, if anything, it looks like things are happening faster than I anticipated. I see either a market crash before the election, or a major downward pull followed by a strong run-up then the crash in Q4/Q1 2025. It is my opinion that a bear market is on the horizon, and we\\'ve already seen a blip of what might be possible when the tumbling begins, so I\\'m making final preparations to go whole hog into even more bearish positions.\\n\\n# Position Update\\n\\nLast post I updated that I\\'d purchased a $480 strike put on QQQ for June 2025 for $3,400. I sold this on 08/05 for $5,750 and traded a short put against it in the meantime to lower my basis. Now, except for a QQQ 430/435 08/16 CCS I sold, I\\'m holding cash and playing earnings, waiting for this green rebound to top out before I reposition into long puts for 2025.'\n",

However, after my last DD (check posts) had not turned out as well I had hoped, I decided to ride this one out myself to see where I would end up. One thing led to another and now here I am, rambling on about an opportunity that has long since passed—or has it?\\n\\nHUMA is a part of one of the most volatile categories in the NYSE: Biotechnology. It specializes in \"the development and manufacture of off-the-shelf, implantable, and bioengineered human tissues for the treatment of diseases and conditions across a range of anatomic locations in multiple therapeutic areas\" (Yahoo Finance). Its stock price has increased approx. 178% during the past year. That\\'s a great future outlook, right?\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nWhy? Because HUMA has yet to face the most challenging aspect of releasing a biotech product: the FDA review. But everyday people and regards alike struggle to understand the jargon-infested reports made by these companies and can rarely predict how a review will turn out. Therefore it is usually necessary for other influencing factors to be present to make a somewhat informed bet on a biotech company. Something reliable that we can measure, something like...insider trades. And boy does HUMA have plenty.\\n\\nOver the past 2 years since Aug 9, 2022, 280k shares of the company have been purchased by insiders. Conversely, 44,071,413 shares of the company have been sold by insiders, including sales by the CEO, Director, and the COO (who has sold all of her shares)\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4d78xpr4qhd1.png?width=2482&format=png&auto=webp&s=17171bc7f6f91d53a27c83af6cac70b13e310e44\\n\\nNow ask yourself this question: If the insiders within HUMA were confident in the success of HUMA, why would they liquidate so much of their equity in it? The answer is simple, they aren\\'t confident in its success. Considering the fact that HUMA is a biotech company, it is likely that insiders believe that HUMA\\'s product will underperform/be declared unqualified during the FDA\\'s review. This will inevitably cause an exponential drop in the company\\'s stock price, and the company will become just another resident in the graveyard of failed biotech companies.\\n\\nAs always, you are welcome to do your own DD, I\\'m just the messenger.\\n\\nPosition: HUMA $5 Put 8/16\\n\\nSources:\\n\\n[FDA announces additional review time required](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/humacyte-announces-fda-communication-additional-200500374.html)\\n\\n[HUMA home page](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HUMA/)\\n\\n[HUMA insider info (Open Insider)](http://openinsider.com/search?q=HUMA)'\n",

They released earnings this week and beat eps revenue raised guidance announced buybacks, and the stock is down like 40% over last few weeks. Analysts estimates are in the 20s (not that this means much) and the stock was in the 20s a few weeks ago. They are getting into compounded GLP-1 inhibitors, announced compounding pharmacy acquisitions, and are very bullish for the short and near term. Don’t know what I’m missing here, but this seems like a tremendous buy. The stock has been trying to go up over the last few days, but it seems there is heavy hedge fund control going on causing plummets based on nothing. A few minutes ago stock was heading towards green and decreased 5% on no news within around a minute.\\n\\nEDIT: Just to show I’m putting my money where my mouth is, here are my positions\\n\\n[HIMS positions](https://ibb.co/xHHsKYj)\\n\\nEDIT2: Deleted cross posts, stock appears green for the first time in a few days finally and is up around 6% from low today as of 1:45 EST\\n\\nEDIT3: Upward trend continues! 7% swing from deep red to green so far today and rising\\n\\n[HIMS 2:17pm EST](https://ibb.co/P5ZtkQB)'\n",

Get paid to enter the trade with decent returns and can benefit from large drop in underlying and increasing skew. If you're wrong and the underlying goes up, you still get paid.
