       "  'selftext': 'Nordstrom on Tuesday posted earnings that blew past Wall Street’s expectations, indicating the department store is making strides in its efforts to cut costs and boost efficiencies. \\n\\nThough the Seattle-based retailer posted earnings per share that were 25 cents higher than expected, it issued tepid guidance for the full year. \\n\\nNordstrom now expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.75 and $2.05, compared to a previous range of $1.65 to $2.05. It anticipates sales will be in a range of a 1% decline to 1% growth from the prior year, compared to previous guidance of down 2% to up 1%. \\n\\nShares rose more than 10% in extended trading.\\n\\nHere’s how the department store did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: 96 cents adjusted vs. 71 cents expected\\n\\nRevenue: $3.89 billion vs. $3.90 billion expected\\n\\nThe company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 3 was $122 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $137 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to supply chain impairments, the retailer posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share. \\n\\nSales rose to $3.89 billion, up about 3.4% from $3.77 billion a year earlier. Revenue came in just shy of analysts’ expectations. \\n\\nAs consumers continue to pull back on discretionary spending in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, retailers have been working to improve operations and cut costs to protect profits against softening demand. \\n\\nDuring the quarter, Nordstrom’s profits fell compared to the same period a year ago, but earnings grew over the last six months. Last year, Nordstrom reported a net loss of $67 million in the six months ended July 29, 2023, but in the same period this year, it posted a profit of $83 million. \\n\\nNordstrom has said it is working to improve its supply chain. Last quarter, it said that the time it takes for online orders to arrive was over 5% faster. It’s also improved the way merchandise is making its way to customers and stores, which it said has helped drive higher conversion and lower return rates. \\n\\nAnother key focus area for the company has been growing its off-price banner, Nordstrom Rack. Over the last couple of quarters, momentum has been growing at Nordstrom Rack and has helped prop up the company’s overall results. During the quarter, sales at Nordstrom Rack were up 8.8%, while comparable sales increased 4.1% compared to the same period a year ago.\\n\\nThat compares to Nordstrom’s mainline banner, which saw net sales and comparable sales each increase by just 0.9%. \\n\\nNordstrom has been working to build more Rack locations and has opened 11 new locations so far this fiscal year, with a goal of opening at least 22 by the end of the year. \\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/27/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q2-2024.html',\n",

But in other respects investors’ headlong rush into the American chipmaker’s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.\\n\\nGalloping sales of Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an\\xa0AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as\\xa0[the world’s most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that title—and $900bn in value—amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. “How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?” Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his\\xa0CNBC\\xa0show last week, referring to Nvidia’s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, “Not an\\xa0*Ursus nvidiaensis*\\xa0in sight.”\\n\\nFor every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the\\xa0S&P\\xa0500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson’s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of\\xa0*The Economist*’s parent company.)\\n\\nInvestment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and\\xa0UBS\\xa0project that Nvidia’s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn—a third more than Apple, tech’s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia’s long-term growth story.\\n\\nThe first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia\\xa0[designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market)\\xa0but does not produce them. That falls to\\xa0[TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into\\xa0AI\\xa0servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of\\xa0TSMC’s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed “customer\\xa0B”, one of two that represent at least 10% of\\xa0TSMC’s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with\\xa0TSMC\\xa0last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia’s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with\\xa0TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current “customer\\xa0A”, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.\\n\\nEven as Nvidia’s and\\xa0TSMC’s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved\\xa0AI\\xa0chip every year, rather than every couple of years.\\xa0TSMC\\xa0is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia’s accelerated timeline fits in with\\xa0TSMC’s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.\\n\\nNvidia’s reliance on\\xa0TSMC\\xa0also highlights the second tension in the bulls’ case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors’ bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.\\n\\nIn August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had “heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance”. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla.\\xa0[AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no\\xa0AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy\\xa0ZT\\xa0Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia’s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia’s market share what Chinese competitors like\\xa0BYD\\xa0did to Tesla’s in electric cars.\\n\\n# Exit pursued by a bear\\n\\nAssuming a killer app eventually emerges—which it hasn’t yet—generative\\xa0ai\\xa0is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT\\xa0query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for\\xa0*U. nvidiaensis*\\xa0to resist.\\xa0■',\n",

By comparison, the list price without insurance and discounts is about $1,000 per month.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatients will need to self-inject using the new Zepbound syringe. The current version uses a single-dose auto-injector pen, which allows patients to inject directly under the skin with the touch of a button.\\n\\n\\n\\nEli Lilly says the vials are easier to manufacture than auto-injector pens, so they will increase the availability of Zepbound. While the lower cost may drive down Lilly's average Zepbound sales price in the short term, the additional sales of the vials “could have a positive impact on Lilly's sales results.”\\n\\nLilly's announcement on Zepbound's cardiovascular benefits comes on the heels of a recent study that found that a group of obese patients using Lilly's Mounjaro (the core ingredient in Tirzepatide), a drug that combines weight loss with diabetes treatment, had a more favorable outcome than a group using Novo Nordisk's Ozempic (the core ingredient in Ozempic), a drug that combines both weight loss and diabetes treatment. Ozempic (Semaglutide), a Novo Nordisk drug that also combines weight loss and diabetes treatment, showed significantly more weight loss than the group of obese patients using Ozempic (Semaglutide), a Novo Nordisk drug that also combines weight loss and diabetes treatment.\\n\\nA Goldman Sachs forecast shows that the global anti-obesity drug market could grow to around $130 billion in annual sales by 2030, compared with just $6 billion earlier in 2023.

       "  'selftext': 'The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company\\'s bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\\n\\nLip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to \"reprioritize various commitments\" and that he remained \"supportive of the company and its important work,\" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.\\n\\nThe former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel\\'s board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel\\'s place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan\\'s responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.\\n\\nOver time, Tan grew frustrated by the company\\'s large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel\\'s risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. \\n\\nThe circumstances around Tan\\'s exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel\\'s strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.\\n\\nTan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.\\n\\nIntel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan\\'s venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nTan\\'s exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders.\\n\\nFormer Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.\\n\\nThis month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.\\n\\nIntel\\'s struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.\\n\\nIntel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel\\'s program, two sources said.\\n\\nTo cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.\\n\\nThe layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel\\'s engineering efforts.\\n\\nGelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel\\'s payroll by 2022.\\n\\nTo Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.\\n\\nTan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel\\'s server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.\\n\\nIntel\\'s workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the \"only-the-paranoid-survive\" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.\\n\\nIntel\\'s turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.\\n\\nAn attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.\\n\\nWithout Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel\\'s manufacturing business.\\n\\nTan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.\\n\\nIntel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Super Micro Computer Inc. is a $35 billion server maker based in Silicon Valley, California that has ridden the wave of AI enthusiasm.  \\n\\nOur 3-month investigation, which included interviews with former senior employees and industry experts as well as a review of litigation records, international corporate and customs records, found glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.  \\n\\nIn 2018, Super Micro was temporarily delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file financial statements. By August 2020, the company was charged by the SEC for “widespread accounting violations,” mainly related to $200+ million in improperly recognized revenue and understated expenses, resulting in artificially elevated sales, earnings and profit margins.  \\n\\nLess than 3 months after paying a $17.5 million SEC settlement, Super Micro began re-hiring top executives that were directly involved in the accounting scandal, per litigation records and interviews with former employees.  \\n\\nA former salesperson told us: “Almost all of them are back. Almost all of the people that were let go that were the cause of this malfeasance.”  \\n\\nAccording to a lawsuit filed in April 2024, Super Micro waited only 3 months after the SEC settlement before restarting “improper revenue recognition,” “recognizing incomplete sales,” and “circumvention of internal accounting controls”.  \\n\\nFull report is here: https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/',\n",

       "  'title': 'Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) Navigating the Evolving COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape with a Diversified Pipeline',\n",
       "  'selftext': '**Overview**\\n\\nModerna, a pioneering biotechnology company, has transformed from a research-stage enterprise into a commercial powerhouse with a diverse clinical portfolio spanning infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company’s first commercial product, the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax®, has already impacted hundreds of millions of lives globally. However, Moderna’s story extends far beyond its COVID-19 success, as it continues to leverage its mRNA platform to advance a robust pipeline of 40 development candidates across 47 programs, 43 of which are currently in clinical studies.\\n\\n**Financials**\\n\\nIn the fiscal year 2023, Moderna reported annual revenue of $6,754 million and a net loss of $4,714 million. The company’s annual operating cash flow was negative $3,118 million, and its annual free cash flow was negative $3,825 million. These financial results reflect the significant investments Moderna is making to advance its diverse pipeline and build out its global commercial, regulatory, sales, and manufacturing infrastructure.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Moderna reported net product sales of $167 million, a significant decline from the $1,828 million reported in the same period of the prior year. This decrease is indicative of the evolving nature of the endemic COVID-19 vaccine market, which has transitioned toward a more seasonal commercial pattern. The company expects this trend to persist, resulting in further projected reductions in net product sales for its COVID-19 vaccine relative to 2023.\\n\\n**Business Overview**\\n\\nDespite the decline in COVID-19 vaccine sales, Moderna remains focused on its long-term strategy of diversifying its revenue streams and advancing its robust pipeline. The company’s COVID-19 vaccine strategy for 2024 is centered on working with public health officials, healthcare providers, and pharmacies to increase vaccination coverage rates, particularly in the United States. In Europe, Moderna is actively participating in the 2024 tender process, which allows for up to 36 million doses per year for up to 4 years. In the Rest of the World, the company has reoriented its commercial teams to prioritize markets for greater commercial focus and impact, as evidenced by the recent contract with Brazil for 4.5 million doses.\\n\\n**Pipeline Progress**\\n\\nModerna’s pipeline progress extends well beyond its COVID-19 vaccine. The company is eagerly awaiting the approval of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, which is expected to launch into a large market. In its first year, the older adult RSV market was $2.5 billion in sales, and analysts expect the older adults’ market to grow between $6 billion and $8 billion per year. Moderna’s RSV vaccine has a strong efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials and will be the only product available in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation, which the company believes will ease the burden on pharmacies during the fall respiratory season.\\n\\nIn addition to its respiratory vaccine portfolio, Moderna is making significant strides in its latent virus vaccines, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The company’s CMV vaccine, mRNA-1647, has fully enrolled its Phase III trial, and Moderna is anticipating potential for Phase III efficacy data in 2024. The EBV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1189, has shown positive Phase I immunogenicity and safety data, and Moderna is now advancing towards pivotal trials.\\n\\nModerna’s individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) program, developed in collaboration with Merck, continues to demonstrate promising results. The partners have initiated three new randomized clinical studies in additional tumor types in 2024, including a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma, a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and a Phase 2/3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\n**Liquidity**\\n\\nThe company’s financial position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling approximately $12.2 billion as of March 31, 2024. This robust balance sheet enables Moderna to continue investing in its pipeline and commercial operations. In March 2024, the company entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement with Blackstone Life Sciences, which will provide up to $750 million in funding to support the advancement of Moderna’s investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccine program.\\n\\nModerna’s commitment to financial discipline is evident in its operating expense management. During the first quarter of 2024, the company’s total operating expenses decreased by almost $800 million compared to the same period in 2023. This reduction was driven by lower spending in manufacturing, development, and selling, general, and administrative functions.\\n\\n**Outlook**\\n\\nLooking ahead, Moderna expects net sales for 2024 to be approximately $4 billion, which the company believes will be a low point as it expects to return to growth in 2025. The company anticipates cost of sales to be approximately 35% of product sales for the full year, down from 70% in 2023, reflecting improvements in manufacturing efficiency and expected reductions in inventory write-downs.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nModerna’s diversified pipeline, strong financial position, and focus on operational efficiency position the company well to navigate the evolving COVID-19 vaccine market and continue advancing its broader therapeutic and vaccine programs. As the company continues to execute on its strategic priorities, investors will closely monitor the progress of its late-stage clinical candidates, including the RSV vaccine, CMV vaccine, and INT program, as well as the potential launch of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine programs.\\n\\nSource: [https://beyondspx.com/2024/07/30/moderna-nasdaqmrna-navigating-the-evolving-covid-19-vaccine-landscape-with-a-diversified-pipeline/](https://beyondspx.com/2024/07/30/moderna-nasdaqmrna-navigating-the-evolving-covid-19-vaccine-landscape-with-a-diversified-pipeline/)',\n",

He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Over time, I\\'ve just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don\\'t have the same confidence that they\\'re going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,\" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla\\'s robotics and full-self-driving tech. \"That\\'s just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company\\'s trajectory. Tesla\\'s stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk\\'s legal battles.\\n\\n\\n\\nGerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he\\'d been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn\\'t actually work there, who doesn\\'t try to sell the cars,\" Gerber said, adding: \"We\\'ve seen sales go down, and that\\'s what\\'s happening. Sales are going down. If you\\'re expecting a great quarter, you\\'re wrong. They\\'re not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla\\'s humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, \\'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?\\' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?\" Gerber said, adding: \"The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don\\'t know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMusk\\'s leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla\\'s board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.\\n\\n  \\nSource: [businessinsider.com](http://businessinsider.com)',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"https://preview.redd.it/925bkw0fp6ld1.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8d12d044ab9fb1ff0e2a26fc60c9b0addabc45d\\n\\n***Photo above***\\xa0*- how is it even possible to lose $44,000 on a car that stickers for $57,000?*  \\n  \\nFull disclosure. I DO NOT drive the hilarious looking electric Mustang Mach E. Or the mind blowingly expensive electrified F150 “Lightning” pickup. But if I did, I'd be responsible for Ford’s $5 billion operating loss on electric vehicles this year. (see link below).  \\n  \\nWait . . . it’s not actually $5 billion. It’s going to be $6.5 billion. Ford is taking a $1.5 billion write-down on the electric SUV factory they just cancelled. Ford announced earlier this month that they are “pivoting” to hybrids. I suppose the (as yet unnamed, and undesigned) 3 row hybrid SUV will compete against similar hybrids from Honda, Hyundai, Jeep, Kia, Mazda, Toyota . . . and GM, I assume you’re going to “pivot” to hybrids too, right? Well, even if legacy US automakers are late to the party, and burdened with that new $140,000 per worker UAW contract, I’m sure there will be at least a few buyers. Octogenarians are still loyal to Buick right?  \\n  \\nI want to make it clear that I actually DO intend to buy an electric car at some point. It’s just that they’re too darn expensive. Ugly as it is, I test drove the Mach-E Mustang. A few months ago, when the dealer stopped charging $2,000 over sticker to reserve one “in transit”. There are several on the lot now. I can see why the dealers were leaning into pre-orders. It’s not an attractive driving appliance. And the $55,793 sticker (as optioned) is pricey, considering I can get a similar Hyundai Ionic 5 for about $15,000 less. They’re both ugly, but if I have to drive ugly, I don’t want to get ripped off. Maybe I could put that $15,000 towards a condo down payment?  \\n  \\nFord is also “pivoting” to a 4 door mustang. Which runs on gasoline. Stop laughing. This is absolutely true. You can google it for yourself. This solves the longstanding problem that only children can get into the rear seat of a 2 door Mustang. But since Mustangs are ALL over $40,000 now, and they aren’t even lithium powered cruise missiles, why is the price so high? The asking price will probably be higher for the upcoming 4 door Mustang. And they’ll ask for a $2,000 deposit to get on the pre-order waiting list. The G-stang Quattroporte Bullet Edition, with brushed platinum cockpit trim.  \\n  \\nI don’t blame the United Auto Workers for any of this. When the president has your back, and shows up to walk the picket line with you, it can be hard to take a deep breath and ask yourself:\\xa0*$140,000 for a high school dropout, who has a screwdriver and pliers on his toolbelt? Am I really worth 3X what a new teacher with a college degree is getting?*  \\n  \\nEarth to UAW – and Ford, and GM – the end of auto manufacturing on US soil may be at hand. You guys (and ladies) have effed this up royally. I already can’t buy any American made appliances. My refrigerator is LG. They also make dishwashers, ovens, washing machines, dryers. All of LG's stuff is top rated by consumer reports. If anyone reading this post knows of a US designed, US assembled refrigerator, please clue us in.  \\n  \\nWe’ve seen this movie before, and it doesn’t have a happy ending. All our cars will be made in Asia, or India, or some other rising 3rd world location. And US dropouts whose only credentials are a certificate for completing screwdriver 101 are going to end up on welfare, or universal basic income. But at least they will have legal weed . . .  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**Ford Loses $44,000 On Every EV Sells As It Switches To Hybrids (yahoo.com)**](https://autos.yahoo.com/ford-loses-44-000-every-142800440.html)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Nvidia Thesis ($200 PT by Dec-2025, 53% Gross, 38% IRR)\\n\\nP.S.: Not financial advice, just my quick read-through of fundamentals\\n\\nNvidia is the world’s largest chip company, spearheading the global AI revolution. It holds a dominant\\xa098% market share\\xa0in Data Center GPUs.\\nLast fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.\\nI believe there’s a\\xa0~50% upside\\xa0in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidia’s Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to\\xa0$200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidia’s typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.\\nKey Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:\\n1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.\\n    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 years—much of it allocated to AI and GPUs.\\n    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.\\n    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3’s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.\\n2. Supply Chain Insights:\\xa0Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect\\n    * TSMC’s CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024—a ~3x increase.\\n    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.\\n    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.\\n    * AMD’s CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030\\n3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:\\n    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Wait . . . what? Crypto industry accounts for HALF of all 2024 campaign contributions?',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"https://preview.redd.it/tuddch49nzkd1.jpg?width=289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0452770c95c4e2cb3eb1ee91da6ce2939be91571\\n\\n***Photo above***\\xa0*- no this ISN'T Disney's magic kingdom. It's the Coinbase Headquarters in San Francisco.*  \\n  \\nThe link below come courtesy of the watchdog group Public Citizen. It says crypto corporations are responsible for half the corporate 2024 donations. Well over $100 million dollars. US political regulations being what they are, most of this money went to PACs, because individual politicians could possibly be embarrassed, and have to answer rude questions, if they appeared to be in the pockets of the crypto guys.  \\n  \\nCoinbase and Ripple are the heavy hitters in this crypto-PAC funding universe. About 80% of the total. Of course, inquiring minds want to know “how much relaxed regulation of crypto does $120 million buy?”  \\n  \\nThe article doesn’t make this clear. But clearly contributions are expected to buy more than $120 million in benefits.  \\n  \\nIs this democrat money or republican money? Clearly both. Lax crypto regulation will be essential no matter who wins. It would be foolish to put all the crypto donations on a single spin of the roulette wheel. Obscure tweaks to IRS regulations on things like wallet IDs and end-to-end tracking of blockchain activity could mean the difference between being a billionaire or facing jail time for tax fraud. If you don’t think tax fraud is a big deal, just ask Former President Trump, and former NJ Senator Menendez.  \\n  \\nI admit that I have a bias against crypto. I simply cannot understand how a bunch of electrons corralled on some offshore server are worth Trillions of dollars. It’s not as if those electrons are related to pharmaceutical patents, or solar technology, or anything else that is going to make earth a slightly more pleasant place. They are simply hoarded acorns, like squirrels are probably starting to bury this time of year. You probably know this fact already: squirrels lose 90% of their acorns each winter. Either birds and deer steal them, or the squirrels simply can remember where they buried something on August 26th, 2024. And no squirrel passwords are even involved.  \\n  \\nImagine how outraged you’d be if you heard that half of all campaign contributions came from Wall Street. Or Elon Musk. Of some multinational organization which wants to legalize Meth and Fentanyl. (Well, you wouldn’t be outraged if you were addicted to Fentanyl. And Bitcoin holders probably aren’t outraged that $100 million has been spent to keep the locations of their buried acorns secret).  \\n  \\nOver $400 billion in crypto thefts have taken place so far. Untold billions more were lost when laptops died and cell phones were snatched. The Sea-Tac airport (Seattle Tacoma) has been immobilized all weekend by hackers who are probably demanding payment in Bitcoin. Like they do when disabling our hospitals, electric plants, and kidnapping people during foreign vacations. Crypto is almost untraceable. And the guys pulling the strings want to keep it that way.  \\n  \\nBecause if crypto WAS transparent to the tax system – like every legitimate currency or banking transaction – it would be game over. The trillions and trillions in global cryptocurrency would become almost worthless. It would rival 1929 or Dutch tulips.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~Crypto industry accounts for almost half of corporate donations in 2024 election, report says – NBC Los Angeles~**](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/business/money-report/crypto-industry-accounts-for-almost-half-of-corporate-donations-in-2024-election-report-says/3494608/)  \\n\",\n",

However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.\\n\\nSince the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.\\n\\n“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.\\n\\nDespite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).\\n\\nEarlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.\\n\\nThese new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.\\n\\nIn June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles \"heavily benefit from unfair subsidies\" and present a \"threat of economic injury\" to European EV producers.',\n",

I\\'ve been reading up on the major financial crises recently (see below summaries in case you\\'re curious) and I am wondering what people think might trigger the next one and when it might happen.\\n\\nWhile there\\'s a lot of hype around AI, which could potentially be a risk factor, it\\'s also highly beneficial in many areas, so I might be off the mark. Additionally, ongoing wars don\\'t seem to be significantly impacting the markets. What do you think could lead to a major downturn?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nSUMMARIES OF MAJOR CRISES \\n\\n1. 1973 Oil Crisis\\n Triggered by the OPEC oil embargo, which led to a quadrupling of oil prices. This caused severe inflation, economic recession, and a sharp decline in stock markets worldwide.\\n\\n2. Black Monday (1987)\\nOn October 19, 1987, global stock markets crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 22.6% in a single day. The exact causes are debated but include computerised trading and overvaluation.\\n\\n3. Japanese Asset Price Bubble (1991)\\nA massive speculative bubble in Japanese real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. The Nikkei index lost about 50% of its value, leading to a prolonged economic slump known as the \"Lost Decade.\"\\n\\n4. Asian Financial Crisis (1997)\\nBeginning in Thailand with the collapse of its currency, the crisis spread across East Asia, leading to massive currency devaluations, stock market declines, and economic turmoil in countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\\n\\n5. Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000)\\nAfter a period of extreme speculation in internet-related companies, the bubble burst, leading to a massive decline in the NASDAQ and global stock markets. Many tech companies went bankrupt, and trillions of dollars in market value were wiped out.\\n\\n6. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008)\\nThe most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the failure of major financial institutions. Stock markets around the world plummeted, leading to the Great Recession.\\n\\n7. European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010)\\nThe crisis started with concerns over Greece\\'s high debt levels and quickly spread to other Eurozone countries. Stock markets across Europe fell sharply, and there were fears of a Euro collapse, leading to significant volatility in global markets.\\n\\n8. Chinese Stock Market Crash (2015)\\nA dramatic decline in the Chinese stock market, fueled by a combination of high levels of margin trading and government intervention. This led to a significant drop in global stock markets, with concerns about China\\'s economic slowdown.\\n',\n",

As for RIVN it is just a complete (excuse my frech) shit show. I bought it during the peak and the stock price never went up from there.

This election cycle my perspectives have shifted as I reached my thirties and what was my top concerns four years ago aren't the same as they are now. From both sides I've heard a lot attention going towards helping middle class families get ahead but I hear nothing about those of us that are independent working class people. Both sides say they care a lot about the middle class family unit but from different angles. I understand they are the backbone of this country but I'm a single guy in a relatively inexpensive state that is struggling. I don't work for a corporation. I work for a small business and I'm treated very well but I can't seem to get ahead in this economy and I'm not sure who is going to have policies that will affect me in a positive way because I don't fit into the picture of either side and as someone who didn't really get taught much of anything about economics or politics im trying my best to learn what I should have in school but im still lost.

See below for more astounding advice from the sage of Omaha . . .*  \\n  \\nThe link below is to MSN.com. And with a headline like that, you just KNOW it has to be BS, right?  \\n  \\nActually, MSN is a compensated partner of “gobankingrates.com”, which was founded in 2004, and lists 407 Uluniu Street #412, Kailua, Hawaii as its legal address. When you google this address, it’s a 3 story “medical arts pavilion” primarily operated plastic surgeons where gobankingrates.com is leasing office space. Okay, do we have enough of a level-set now?  \\n  \\nThere is no evidence that the author of this article – Josephine Nesbit – ever interviewed Warren Buffet at any time in her life. In fact, there’s no evidence that this even a real person. The only Josephine Nesbit in Wikipedia is the commanding officer of US military nurses in Bataan during World War 2, and she died of old age 30 years ago. So was this article written by Artificial Intelligence? Josephine, if you’re reading this, please reply.  \\n  \\nIn any case, Josephine’s advice to “poor people” is hilarious. It includes things like:\\n\\n* buy a wonderful company at a fair price, rather than a fair company at a wonderful price (you can see why I’m suspicious about AI involvement)\\n* Pay off all your credit cards\\n* Consider side hustles to make ends meet: delivering newspapers, retrieving & selling used golf balls, buffing cars . . .\\n* Stop gambling and wagering (actually, this is good advice for anyone, rich or poor)\\n\\nIf you want to read the entire list, it\\'s in the link below.  \\n  \\nSo why am I picking on poor “Josephine” and gobankingrates.com? Because there is tidal wave of crapola like this flooding the internet. Disjointed ramblings cobbled together from previous articles. Previous articles which may have been written by AI as well.  \\n  \\nThis is known as “recursive AI cannibalism”. Where expert systems scour the internet ten times a second looking for new text to refine its own content. And – in the case of gobankingrates.com – to shove it at us (with advertising) through its partners like MSN, CNN, and MarketWatch. And many of their \"partners\" are the same banks hawking credit cards which the site is urging us to pay off.  \\n  \\nI have just one suggestion about what “poor people” should do this year. Research the election issues, and don’t get snookered into voting for a cult, or someone who promises to wave a magic wand and make your personal debts disappear by increasing the national debt. This advice applies to the middle class and rich people, too.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/warren-buffett-10-things-poor-people-waste-money-on/ar-BB1r6xET?ocid=msedgntp&pc=HCTS&cvid=29f300db66b5452cbe60ea1476daf24c&ei=187)',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"There is a phenomena known as jobless growth which has been discussed by experts and others. But right now I want to discuss 'rightless growth', which I haven't seen discussed anywhere before. It is a growth in the economy, unaccompanied by growth in human rights. It has been happening in many countries, as democracy has been declining in the 21st century.\\n\\nWhat use is money and property, if you don't have freedom, privacy, and security? Personally my human rights started declining at the beginning of this century, a steeper descent at the beginning of this decade, and a further erosion at the beginning of this year. Money is most useful, when you can use it to buy the goods and services you want. If you don't have freedom to spend as you wish, on food and beverages, travel etc., how useful is the money? If you want access to truth, and you are willing to pay for it, but the media is not free to discuss the truth, how useful is your money? If the authorities can have you under surveillance and detain you when you break one of their secret rules, you won't be free to live and spend as you wish.\\n\\nI am mostly speaking from personal experience. But reputable sources have noted a decline in democracy and freedom. Those who claim to support democracy, while not supporting freedom, are wrong. Whether it are well known authors trying to stop innovation in AI, or authoritarian leaders trying to stop opposition and criticism. I can tell you from personal experience, that freedom is declining in India. But the economy is growing at about seven percent per annum. Right here is an example of rightless growth.\\n\\nBut look at your own country, whether it is China, USA, or otherwise. And ask yourself. What are the risks to human rights and freedom. If the economy is growing, what about human rights, including personal and economic freedom?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Here’s a question:\\nGen AI costs a lot. It will inevitably change the world, but the question is how much money it will be able to generate.\\n\\n\\nBack then when internet came and reformed the world, it has opened a completely new market.\\nLet’s talk big here - advertising.\\n\\n\\nOf course AI is opening a lot of new markets, but small markets. It is essentially an improvement on the internet. But how will it disrupt the advertising market? \\n\\n\\nPopulation growth is slowing down. Almost everyone has a smartphone now, and almost everyone spends as much time on the internet as they can. Maybe there is growth until gen X gets completely replaced, where really almost everyone will actively use the internet for everything.\\n\\n\\nMy question is at the current status of the world, is it the case of large companies stealing each others share from the market, or there are still parts left from the cake?\\n\\n\\nIn limited people in the world, with limited people left to conquer, everyone having smart phone, watching the maximum amount of ads people tolerate, what’s left to get? The only way I see here is to sell more expensive ads. How can companies keep up with the extreme growth rate we seen in tech so far?\\n\\n\\nMaybe AI can create even more accurately targeted ads, with extremely high conversion rate, in which case ads can be sold for more, but still there won’t be that much more people to show more ads to. Can the ads performance justify the massive costs of AI, or it’s just the case of every large company burning up their money on AI just to cover their existing shares from the market, in which case I can’t see uptrend there, just a massive bear market.\\n\\n\\nIn any case, I see Meta a very strong player here, the disruption of making LLAMA open source was just brilliant, strong on ads, and one of the earliest players in the ai game.\\n\\n\\nWhat do you think?',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'There’s been a lot of talk recently about how there isn’t enough people for the replacement level. In 20-30 years it’s projected only African countries that are seeing an increase in economical development now will be reproducing above the replacement level. Now for capitalistic greed, yeah I can see how the replacement level is a problem. But honestly is it really a problem? Sure the people born between say 1980-2050 will live through the time scientists are saying that is gonna be the peak of the population on earth. After that though and the huge influx of people born after world war 2 are gone, there’s gonna be a ton of infrastructure built to support that huge population but the population will be going down instead of up with our current trend for a while. This means that we are building homes now to try to end homelessness but honestly in 70-80 years it’ll abandoned homes everywhere and the prices of them will come down since there will be more homes than people given our building rate vs replacement level. That means that the prices for everything will go down and stabilize at a much more reasonable level for everyone. Now what can stop this is if corporations keep buying up all the homes and in that time make it so that there’s no option but to rent since they buy all the available homes and nobody can own but it feels there just won’t be enough people for stuff like properly running all the areas where the population doesn’t keep requiring the infrastructure it has. Think of how it is for Detroit but with less crime. They built a ton of infrastructure then the population greatly declined and now there’s more infrastructure than what’s needed so they’ve been able to recently get people to move back because it’s so cheap to live there with there being so much excess and so little people as far as land and opportunity is concerned.\\n\\nAnyone else been thinking of this for our future generations? The ME generation made sure to rob the futures of the generations to come instead of following with “the children are the future” like we always have.\\n\\nWhat’s everyone’s opinions on replacement level theory and the population limit and where things will go for the future generations?',\n",

Tik Tok recommends you use a $3 hacksaw, and rubber gloves. Stay safe!*  \\n  \\nFord has cancelled ANOTHER electric vehicle. This time it was an (unnamed) giant 3 row SUV. It also stopped construction on a different EV assembly line earlier this year, and hit the reset button for it’s battery plant. See link below on this week’s cancellation.  \\n  \\nFord CEO Jim Farley tried to put lipstick on this, calling it an “overhaul of Ford’s strategy”. WTH? You need to overhaul something that’s brand new? Sounds like what happened to my brother’s Ford Ranger before it was even paid for.\\xa0**F**ix\\xa0**O**r\\xa0**R**epair\\xa0**D**aily?  \\n  \\nThat snark is probably unfair to Ford. They do make the planet’s best-selling full size pickup – the F150. Evidently, they’re going to build more of those instead of 3 row EV SUVs, and EV pickups. The car enthusiast magazines have REALLY been on Ford's case about EV Pickups. And GM. Apparently once you hitch up your boat or snowmobile trailer, you can kiss your range goodbye. Something about EV pickups are challenged when trying to haul around their 1,000 pound of batteries PLUS whatever is on the trailer. Lawn crews might still buy EV pickups because they don’t go more than 50-100 miles in a day. If they wanted to spend $100,000 to get to the lawns they mow. But lawn crews only go 50-100 miles a day, so their gas isn’t a huge expense to begin with.  \\n  \\nSomeone wants to blame EV cancellations on the shortage of (working) public EV charging stations, I’m sure. The “installers” got big government grants to set them up, but there’s no cash coming in to fix them when broken. Plus, there's a trendy new crime of sawing off the giant copper filled charging cables (for resale).  \\n  \\nThe government appropriated $7.5 billion (as part of it’s inflation fighting legislation) to install 50,000 public chargers. Since only a couple hundred have been installed in the 2 years since the bill passed, does the snails pace help, or hurt, inflation? This IS a trick question – think carefully about it.  \\n  \\nFord CEO Farley says his company is playing “catch up” with Japanese and Korean EV makers. Catch up? Catch up? Those guys started a thousand Kilometers behind Tesla, and now Asia is ahead? America INVENTED the modern EV, but now we’re behind? This almost defies belief, doesn’t it?  \\n  \\nIn the interest of full disclosure, this writer admits she actually BOUGHT a couple hundred shares of Ford stock last week. At around $10.50 a share. Because Ford announced they were pivoting to hybrids, and away from EVs. Which is great news. If you’ve ever gone to your Toyota dealer to test drive the newly redesigned Prius, you know what I'm saying. Those things are sold out, all the time. And hybrids don’t require charging stations. Either government subsidized public ones or installed in your garage. And hybrids cost thousands less to buy. The market has spoken!  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~Ford delays new EV plant, cancels electric three-row SUV as it shifts strategy (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-delays-new-ev-plant-cancels-electric-three-row-suv-as-it-shifts-strategy/ar-AA1pbbno?ocid=BingNewsSerp)  \\n  \\n[**~Ford scraps plan for electric SUV as it unveils overhaul of new EV strategy (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-to-overhaul-ev-strategy-with-more-and-cheaper-options-in-its-latest-push-for-profit/ar-AA1pbqqk?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\",\n",

It was changed to \"trespasses\" around 1000 so that the Roman Catholic Church could support the growth of financial wealth, thus upending centuries of economic theory that used models much more sophisticated than any \"modern theory\" model.\\n\\nThe reason for forgiving debts was to prevent the rise of \"wealthy families\" or an Oligarchy.  Wealth was seen to be addictive which caused instability in society leading to economic collapse.\\n\\nFrom here, my summary of his many, many, many words.\\n\\nIf someone made a loan to another person and the second person could not pay it off then the first person was seen as having made a bad bet and would be responsible for the loss just as much as the second person.  (Hudson doesn\\'t say it, but bankruptcy)\\n\\nJoe Biden eliminated bankruptcy thus allowing the Oligarchy to grow resulting in the strangled American economy we see today.\\n\\nChina makes most of its loans through its central bank.  If one of its loans goes bad, they can write it off.  The central bank then creates more money (just as the US Fed does) which is invested in infrastructure (which the US does not) and the Chinese economy grows.\\n\\nChina\\'s Belt and Road does this same thing with foreign investment.  Their loans are not \"debt traps\" (which the MSM is always warning about but which is actually the US process not China\\'s).  The loans to foreign nations have no payments until the infrastructure those loans were to develop start paying off.  If the project fails, the loan is written off.\\n\\nThere\\'s some stuff in this video about why Islam does not allow usury and some very disparaging remarks about Kennedy.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"How about rules and regulations on leveraged buyouts for private equity? \\n\\n1. At least 50% of buyout must come from PE's own funds.\\n2. Debt piled on the company being acquired cannot be more than 3x of its revenue, unless it has had a positive net income for previous 3 years, in which case at the most 8x it's revenue.\\n3. Remaining funds for buyout must come from banking partners - whoever is willing to provide the funds, based on their past records or their business relationships with the PE firm.\\n\\n\\nI'm unable to gauge the advantages of disadvantages of these rules. I think it'd prevent crazy situations like Red Lobster situation and situation with Subway where to pay off the debt that was piled onto it to acquire Subway, which raised prices, lost customers and now is offering a 'promotion' for a footlong for $6.99\\n\\nWhat would be the disadvantages? If a PE firm is so sure that a company has good fundamentals but is being mis-managed, why not put more of your money in a Buyout so that when it sells you get more money back, rather than piling it in debt which will make the company look much worse with massively increased liabilities.\",\n",

Sell the house and make at worst \\\\~200k a piece so really only spending 250 billion total since they're making the money back then you can give that money back to the other government spending after a year so they get the money back mostly\\n\\nObviously major considerations are how many skilled workers are needed (framers, foundation, electrical, plumbing etc) so maybe this plan could be more of a 5-10 year plan and still only need 130-260 billion a year which compared to all of these other systems is small and you just cut them by 2.5%-5% which is negligible and now we've caught up to supply in the us within 10 years.\\n\\nBut like fixing housing in 5 years is relatively easy to do based on what im seeing with this and would massively benefit the average american.

The bill would also give the state attorney general the power to sue if developers are not compliant.\"\\n\\nShould AI be regulated at the state level, or at a higher level? If AI is over regulated in USA, will it be at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies? Perhaps now is the time for an international treaty on AI regulations, which includes Europe, China, India, and USA. \\n\\nI don\\'t know the details of the California AI regulations. But I don\\'t think state by state regulation is a good idea. If the regulations are too strict, it will only drive AI startups out of California. Reducing California business innovation and state revenues. \\n\\nThe federal government should have AI experts working with lawyers and other experts, to come up with federal regulations. I don\\'t know what they have now. But they may need permanent staff, to keep up with rapidly advancing technology.\\n\\nReference: https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-says-california-ai-bills-benefits-likely-outweigh-costs-2024-08-23/',\n",

This is what they turn into when you cook them at the right temperature and time.*  \\n  \\nBotswana just found the worlds 2nd largest diamond ever. 2,492 carats. I’m not a gemologist, but that thing looks pretty good. How much is it worth? 1 carat flawless diamonds go for around $8,000 (there’s a range up to $16,000). So this one might be worth $20 million (2,492 X $8,000). Or possibly more, if you believe jewelers that 2 carat diamonds are worth MUCH more than double a 1 carat diamond, etc. This spud is 2,492 carats.  \\n  \\nCould this pay off Botswana’s national debt? I was curious, so I looked it up. Not even close. They owe $3.5 billion. That SOUNDS like a lot, until you remember that the US national debt is $35 Trillion – 10,000X higher. But the USA has 100X more people. So Botswana’s national debt – per capita – is a still a tiny fraction of the USA, on a per capita basis. Its only 1/100th (1 percent) as much, on a per capita basis.  \\n  \\nOkay, I hear the guy in the back yelling: “You have to calculate debt on the GDP (gross domestic product) of a nation. I did that too. Botswana’s national debt compared to GDP is 20%. The USA is 120%. Not to hammer the point to hard, but the USA has 1/3 of the entire planet’s national debt.  \\n  \\nWe ARE living large, right?  \\n  \\nWait . . . someone says we’re NOT doing that well? Despite having borrowed all that $35 trillion, we still have homeless tent encampments, crappy health care, crappy public schools, 17,000 bridges rated “poor” and in danger of imminent collapse. I can keep going.  \\n  \\nWhere did the $35 trillion go then?  \\n  \\nWell, it certainly didn’t fix any of the problems listed above. We probably spent it on stupid stuff. Like 800 military bases around the globe. Giant orbiting telescopes, competing to look back to “the moment of creation”. Giant tax rebates on teslas that can exceed the speed limit in 3 seconds from a standing start. Milk price supports. Strategic cheese stockpiles. Public housing that gets torn down only 20 years after it’s built. Billion dollar sports stadiums built to lure teams to your city.  \\n  \\nAmerica is about to have the most expensive election in history. Kamala Harris is raising $100 million a week in campaign contributions and spending it immediately on TV ads. Trump would do the same, if he could convince people to donate as much.  \\n  \\nNeither of these candidates are discussing the national debt. If it doesn’t come up at the debate next month, then we’re being conned. Because the media and everyone involved knows this can’t keep happening.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~World’s second-largest diamond discovered in Botswana – NBC New York~**](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/money-report/worlds-second-largest-diamond-discovered-in-botswana/5730315/)',\n",

Took a while to write and just want to put it out there.\\n\\nDon\\'t expect any response.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\n\\n\\n>widespread perception that China is angling for a position as global hegemon.\\n\\nIf you were to add the adjective \"economic hegemon\", you would be right.  However PNAC formed in the \\'90s was set up to make the USA the world\\'s hegemon -- no matter what adjective you might modify it with.\\n\\n>China makes for a convenient enemy to rail against.\\n\\nThis is very true.\\n\\nThe arguments you make in your last paragraph are very effectively countered by Kevin Wamsley on the \"Inside China Business\" channel.  A few examples.  Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson would also dispute your claims.\\n\\n[The claim that China does not respect IP is rather moot given how the US sanctions have totally failed to accomplish much.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIYR8Rrvaf0)\\n\\nThere are many complaints that China is \"dumping\" but [the truth is that often China can build better products at much less cost.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccSh1G7Sc38)  Thus Biden\\'s announcement of 100% tariffs on BYD cars\\n\\n[Yanis Varoufakis has many videos countering the claims of a Chinese debt trap.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbLFFmQs7BU)  There are dozens of examples where the Chinese have renegotiated the deal with various nations.  For sure, if there is a \"Chinese debt trap\" it is much, much easier to escape than from the one\\'s set up by the IMF or World Bank at the behest of the USA.\\n\\nI don\\'t see videos everyday of police bashing in heads in China like I do all across the USA.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators.\\n\\nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it’s sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries.\\n\\nThe team will work with the California Highway Patrol to “examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response,” the agency said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 3:15 a.m. Monday near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder.\\n\\nThe battery caught fire, spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1,000 degrees, forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out, the Highway Patrol told the newspaper. The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital, and the freeway was temporarily closed.\\n\\nThe battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup, and the freeway didn’t reopen until 7:20 p.m., authorities said.\\n\\nA message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla.\\n\\nAfter an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate.\\n\\nThe agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said.\\n\\nTesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/roadside-tesla-semi-fire-where-temperatures-reached-1000-degrees-draws-in-ntsb-investigative-team.html',\n",

But I want to adjust the income by the higher cost of living from where I live (germany), so that the income represents the same amount of resources that can be bought. I find the indices accounting for that very difficult to understand/apply and they should also be the global average per person (and not country). I understand that the costs of good vary depending on region and kind but I just want a gross estimate. Can someone help me out? Thanks :)',\n",

       "  'title': 'GM-owned Cruise will partner with Uber to offer driverless rides',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Uber Technologies and General Motors\\' Cruise have agreed to a multi-year partnership, under which the embattled autonomous vehicle company plans to offer driverless rides to Uber users as soon as next year.\\n\\nThe Thursday announcement comes as Cruise attempts to revive its robotaxi business after the company ceased operations following an October 2023 incident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a driverless Cruise vehicle after she was first struck by a human driver in another car.\\n\\nState and federal regulators have investigated the incident, which led to an exodus of Cruise leaders including CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, as well as significant layoffs.\\n\\nBoth Cruise CEO Marc Whitten and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hailed the partnership in a press release, stressing that the companies believe autonomous vehicles can be deployed safely.\\n\\n\"Cruise is on a mission to leverage driverless technology to create safer streets and redefine urban life,\" Whitten said in the release. \"We are excited to partner with Uber to bring the benefits of safe, reliable, autonomous driving to even more people, unlocking a new era of urban mobility.\"\\n\\nKhosrowshahi said in the release that Uber is \"thrilled to partner with Cruise and look forward to launching next year.\" \\n\\nIn 2016, Uber aimed to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology and partnered with Volvo to do so. But it abandoned the effort after a 2018 incident, in which an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a woman named Elaine Herzberg as she was walking her bicycle across a road in Tempe, Arizona. The Uber safety driver on board at the time, Rafaela Vasquez, was ultimately held legally liable for the incident.\\n\\nSince then, Uber has emerged as a partner to other autonomous vehicle developers. It has partnered with Google-owned Waymo to offer driverless rides or food delivery to Uber users via robotaxis in Arizona.\\n\\nOn Uber\\'s most recent earnings call, analysts asked the company how the emergence of robotaxis would likely impact the ridehailing giant\\'s business long-term.\\n\\nKhosrowshahi said on the call that \"AV players\" experience much higher utilization with Uber than they do \"without a network on a first-party basis.\" He also predicted there will be a \"pretty long hybrid period as autonomous is developing and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it.\" He added, \"We don\\'t think this will be a winner-take-all market.\"\\n\\nCruise competitor Waymo said this week that it is already delivering 100,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in cities where it operates commercially in the US: San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. The company is also testing in and plans to expand its service into Austin, Texas.\\n\\nThe new partnership isn\\'t the first time GM has partnered with a ride-haling company. GM invested $500 million in Lyft in early 2016, with plans to eventually develop a fleet of autonomous vehicles that could be summoned using Lyft\\'s mobile app. That never happened, as GM decided to instead launch its own vehicles and network through Cruise.\\n\\nA Cruise spokeswoman said the company remains focused on relaunching its own driverless ridehailing service and app, despite the Thursday announcement.\\n\\nCruise is currently conducting supervised autonomous vehicle testing with a safety driver in Phoenix, Dallas and Houston.\\n\\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/08/22/gm-owned-cruise-will-partner-with-uber-to-offer-driverless-rides.html',\n",

       "  'title': 'Peloton to start charging subscribers with used equipment $95 activation fee ',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Peloton on Thursday said it will start charging new subscribers a one-time $95 activation fee if they bought their hardware on the secondary market as more consumers snag lightly used equipment for a fraction of the typical retail price.\\n\\nThe used equipment activation fee for subscribers in the U.S. and Canada comes as Peloton starts to see a meaningful increase in new members who bought used Bikes or Treads from peer-to-peer markets such as Facebook Marketplace. \\n\\nDuring its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, Peloton said it saw a “steady stream of paid connected fitness subscribers” who bought hardware on the secondary market. The company said the segment grew 16% year over year.\\n\\n“We believe a meaningful share of these subscribers are incremental, and they exhibit lower net churn rates than rental subscribers,” the company said in a letter to shareholders. \\n\\n“It’s also worth highlighting that this activation fee will be a source of incremental revenue and gross profit for us, helping to support our investments in improving the fitness experience for our members,” interim co-CEO Christopher Bruzzo later added on a call with analysts. \\n\\nWhile plenty of Peloton subscribers are avid users of the home workout machines, some have likened them to glorified clothes racks because so many people stop using the equipment. Those people paid Peloton for that hardware originally, but importantly, many of them have canceled their monthly subscription, which is how Peloton makes the bulk of its money. \\n\\nThe ability to attract new, budget-conscious members from the secondary market who are willing to pay for a monthly subscription is a unique opportunity for Peloton to grow revenue without any upfront cost, on top of the revenue from the original sale. \\n\\nAri Kimmelfeld — whose startup Trade My Stuff, formerly known as Trade My Spin, sells used Peloton equipment — estimates there are around a million Bikes collecting dust in homes around the world that could be a source of new revenue for the company. \\n\\nHe told CNBC he previously met with Peloton executives to discuss ways to collaborate, because every time he sells a used piece of equipment, it could lead to more than $500 in new revenue per year for Peloton. With the new used equipment activation fee, that number could grow to more than $600 for the first year. \\n\\n“We save the customer a lot more than $95,” Kimmelfeld told CNBC on Thursday after the new activation fee was announced. “I don’t think it’ll stop or slow down people from buying secondary equipment … because you can get a bike delivered faster and cheaper on the secondary market, even with the $95, let’s call it a tax, from Peloton.” \\n\\nTrade My Stuff sells first-generation Bikes for $499, compared with $1,445 new. It offers the Bike+ for $1,199, compared with $2,495 new. It also sells used Treads for $1,999, compared with $2,995 new. \\n\\nSince launching his business, Kimmelfeld has worked with people looking to sell their used Peloton equipment and has since sold a “few thousand” Bikes. In 14 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Denver and New York City, the company offers same- or next-day delivery. Outside of those locales, it provides delivery within three to five days. That compares with a new Peloton purchase, which can take significantly longer to deliver. \\n\\nThe used equipment activation fee is designed to ensure that new members “receive the same high-quality onboarding experience Peloton is known for,” the company said. Bruzzo said that those who buy a used Bike or Bike+ have access to a virtual custom fitting ahead of their first ride, as well as a history summary that shows how many rides those bikes had before they were resold. \\n\\n“We’re also offering these new members discounts on accessories such as bike shoes, bike mats and spare parts,” said Bruzzo. “We’ll continue to lean into this important channel and find additional ways to improve the new member experience, for example, providing early education about the broad range of fitness modalities that we offer and the many series and programs our instructors provide to new members.”\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/peloton-to-charge-95-activation-fee-for-used-bikes-.html',\n",

       "  'selftext': '[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/july-home-sales-break-4-month-losing-streak-as-supply-rises-nearly-20percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/july-home-sales-break-4-month-losing-streak-as-supply-rises-nearly-20percent.html)\\n\\nClosed sales of previously owned homes rose 1.3% in July compared with June to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.95 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was the first gain in five months.\\n\\nSales were\\xa02.5% lower compared with the same time last year.\\n\\nSales saw the biggest gains in the Northeast and were flat in the Midwest. Prices also rose the most in the Northeast.\\n\\n“Despite the modest gain, home sales are still sluggish,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, in a release. “But consumers are definitely seeing more choices, and affordability is improving due to lower interest rates.”\\n\\nThese sales are based on contracts that were likely signed in May and June, when mortgage rates were well over 7% on the popular 30-year fixed loan. Rates began dropping in July and are\\xa0now hovering around 6.5%.\\n\\nAll-cash offers made up 27% of July sales, up from 26% the year before and far higher than the historical norm.\\n\\nThe supply of homes for sale continued to move higher in July. At the end of the month, there were\\xa01.33 million homes on the market, an increase of\\xa00.8% from June and 19.8% higher than in July 2023. At the current sales pace, that represents a\\xa0four-month supply, slightly lower than it was in June.\\n\\nThe increase in supply did not, however, help to cool home prices. The median price of an existing home sold in July was $442,600, an increase of 4.2% year-over-year.\\n\\nFirst-time buyers made up 29% of sales in July, unchanged from June but down from 30% in July 2023. Historically, these buyers make up closer to 40% of home sales, but affordability has been hit hard in the last two years due to fast-rising home prices and higher mortgage rates.\\n\\nWith rates now slightly lower, demand is starting to pick up. A separate report from Redfin, a real estate brokerage, found requests for tours and other buying services from Redfin agents rose 4% over the last week to its highest level in two months.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Peloton shares rise more than 10% as turnaround plan takes hold, losses shrink ',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Peloton said Thursday it is digging itself out of the red and eked out a slight sales increase for the first time in nine quarters as it slashed its overall losses. \\n\\nThe beleaguered connected fitness company, which is currently being run by two board members after former CEO Barry McCarthy resigned earlier this year, saw sales grow by 0.2% during its fiscal fourth quarter. While only a modest uptick, it’s the first time Peloton posted year-over-year revenue growth since its 2021 holiday quarter. \\n\\nThe company also indicated it’s ready to focus on profitability over growth with significant cuts to its marketing and sales spending and meaningful increases to free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Those cuts helped Peloton narrow its quarterly losses to $30.5 million from $241.1 million in the year-ago period.\\n\\nThe company’s shares rose more than 10% in premarket trading.\\n\\nHere’s how the Bike and Tread maker performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nLoss per share: 8 cents vs. 17 cents expected\\n\\nRevenue: $644 million vs. $631 million expected\\n\\nFor the three-month period that ended June 30, Peloton significantly narrowed its losses. The company posted a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a loss of $241.8 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. \\n\\nSales rose to $643.6 million, up about 0.2% from $642.1 million a year earlier. That’s only a $1.5 million increase, but Peloton did it at a time when sales are typically a bit slower for the company, because the quarter bleeds into the summer when people are more focused on going out and traveling than working out. The last time Peloton delivered year-over-year sales growth was during its holiday season in 2021, which is typically the company’s strongest quarter.\\n\\nSecondary market gains\\n\\nDuring the quarter, sales for Peloton’s pricy connected fitness hardware fell about 4%, continuing a trend for the company. But subscription revenue rose by 2.3%, and the segment’s gross margin increased by 1 percentage point.\\n\\nThough hardware sales were down, Peloton is growing its subscription revenue through the secondary market where people can buy used stationary bikes for a fraction of the cost of a new one. During the quarter, subscription revenue from hardware purchased on the secondary market grew 16% year over year.\\n\\n“We believe a meaningful share of these subscribers are incremental, and they exhibit lower net churn rates than rental subscribers,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.\\n\\nWhile hardware sales have hurt Peloton’s overall performance, sales for its Tread are growing after it overcame a costly recall. During the quarter, sales from Peloton’s treadmill portfolio grew 42% year over year.\\n\\nThe company is also seeing some positive signs in its Bike rental program, which allowed it to clear through a glut of inventory. During the quarter, average net monthly paid subscription churn for rentals was down 1.1 percentage points. Demand has been so steady, it no longer has the refurbished inventory levels necessary to supply that side of the program. The company ceased offering its original Bike rental program on Aug. 1 and since then, has seen demand grow for its Bike+ rental, refurbished original Bike sales and financed new Bike sales.\\n\\n“These alternative programs have stronger unit economics than original Bike rental, with more cash paid upfront and a stronger retention profile,” the company said in its shareholder letter.\\n\\nEver since Peloton’s pandemic heyday came to an end, the company has struggled to generate free cash flow and ensure it has enough assets on its balance sheet to cover its many liabilities. Earlier this year, it announced a sprawling restructuring plan that included cutting 15% of the company’s global workforce to achieve $200 million in annualized cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025.\\n\\nThose efforts are starting to bear fruit.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, Peloton delivered adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the second consecutive quarter – a feat it had not pulled off since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. It posted $70 million of adjusted EBITDA, far more than the $53 million that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. \\n\\nThat metric was up $105 million compared with the year-ago period and $64 million quarter over quarter.\\n\\nPeloton also generated $26 million in free cash flow, compared with negative $74 million in the year-ago period and $8 million in the prior quarter.\\n\\nImprovements to Peloton’s balance sheet come after the company completed massive refinancing of its debt that staved off a looming liquidity crunch and pushed out its debt maturities by several years.\\n\\nPeloton noted that the search for its next CEO is “top of mind for all stakeholders.” “The process is well underway and we look forward to sharing more when we have an announcement,” it said.\\n\\nProfit over growth\\n\\nFor the year ahead, Peloton is planning to invest in its hardware and software to deliver a better user experience, among other initiatives. However, its guidance assumes that investments in these new initiatives “will not deliver subscriber growth within the fiscal year,” indicating Peloton may finally be shifting its focus away from growth in favor of profitability and free cash flow generation.\\n\\nThat’s evidenced by its reductions to sales and marketing spending — an expense that has long dragged down Peloton’s balance sheet and has been criticized as being too high for the company’s size.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, Peloton cut sales and marketing spending by $25.5 million, or 19% year over year. It said it expects to continue to make reductions to its marketing budget throughout fiscal 2025.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, Peloton is projecting sales to be worse than Wall Street expected but is guiding to higher-than-forecast adjusted EBITDA. The company said it anticipates sales to be between $560 million and $580 million, compared with estimates of $609 million, according to LSEG. It’s expecting to post adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $60 million, compared with estimates of $45 million, according to StreetAccount.\\n\\nStreetAccount analysts had expected the number of connected fitness subscribers to be 2.96 million during the current quarter, but Peloton projects a range of 2.88 million to 2.89 million instead.\\n\\nFor the full year, Peloton expects sales to be between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, compared with estimates of $2.7 billion, according to LSEG.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2024.html',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Little debate in a local sub here got me crunching some numbers, and it's way worse than I could have imagined. This is for the OKC metro, so don't take this as applicable to any other market without checking first, but I have a feeling it's applicable to a lot of markets, if not most...or all.\\n\\nI picked this house to use as the example because it's pretty average all around and sold recently: [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1928-NW-10th-St-Oklahoma-City-OK-73106/21840411\\\\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1928-NW-10th-St-Oklahoma-City-OK-73106/21840411_zpid/)\\n\\nI generously estimate that it would rent for a dollar a square foot a month, so we'll be extra generous and say 1500 a month for rent.\\n\\nAt its sold price, the mortgage on it would be about 1200 a month, assuming very low taxes and insurance. Average maintenance, bare minimum, would bring that up to 1350. So best case scenario, you're saving 150 a month. More realistically you're breaking even or maybe even losing a little, and for the privilege of being a weekend DIY warrior whenever there's a drippy faucet or something needs a fresh coat of paint.\\n\\nBut it's a great long term investment right?\\n\\nAt 7%, you would pay over 400k for the house at the end of the term, not including maintenance or increases in taxes and insurance. Best case scenario you would hope to refi after a few years down to 3% and end up with a total investment in the house under 400k at the end of the term.\\n\\nAssuming an average 2% annual appreciation, that house would only be worth about 300k at the end of the term. So best case scenario, you would be 100k in the hole, and a more realistic scenario might be more like 200k.\\n\\nVs if you took that 35k dollars and bought a 30 year treasury at the current 4 point something percent, you would make a guaranteed 100k dollars in that same 30 year period.\\n\\nUnless someone can either pay cash or at least pay off a house in less than 15 years, I can't see any even remotely likely scenario where buying a house makes ANY sense right now. It seems the only logical course of action would be to put that down payment in a bill or note at 5% and wait on the sidelines until either rents go up or home prices and or rates come down. If you buy a house on a 30 year note right now, basically you're renting it from the bank and taking over all the liability for it. It would be like renting a house on a 30 year lease and then paying for upkeep, insurance, etc. out of your own pocket.\\n\\nINSANE!😲\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) shut down their rail networks in the country on Thursday and locked out nearly 10,000 workers after unsuccessful negotiations with a major labor union.\\n\\nThe decision, confirmed by the Teamsters union, sets the stage for an unprecedented rail stoppage that could badly damage the Canadian economy and have a significant effect on cross-border trade with the United States.\\n\\nCanada is the world’s second-largest country by area and relies heavily on rail transport. The stoppage is set to cripple shipments of grain, potash and coal while also slowing the transport of petroleum products, chemicals and autos.\\n\\nIndustry groups had urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to prevent a stoppage, noting Canada’s railways transport around C$380 billion ($277 billion) worth of goods annually.\\n\\nU.S. railroad Union Pacific said on Tuesday a stoppage would halt the movement of 2,500 rail cars across the border daily.\\n\\nThe Canadian and U.S. economies are highly integrated. Rail transport accounted for 14% of total bilateral trade of $382.4 billion between the countries for the first half of the year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\\n\\nThe stoppage comes after months of talks. The union and the companies struggled to reach an agreement on key terms, with both sides accusing the other of bad faith.\\n\\nThe union is seeking improved provisions for fatigue, rest, and scheduling, stressing the need for worker safety.\\n\\nCN said it had offered better wages and fewer working days, but the “union did not respond”, while CPKC said its offer included competitive wage hikes and increased shift differentials.\\n\\nHowever, CPKC said that a negotiated outcome with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) union was not within reach and the companies urged the union to engage in negotiations.\\n\\nTeamsters said none of its offers were “seriously considered” by the companies, adding that it will remain at the bargaining table with both firms despite the lockout.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/cn-rail-cpkc-shut-freight-network-after-impasse-over-union-talks.html',\n",

We estimate access to legal betting is associated with no average population-wide impacts on either self-reported measure, and do not find evidence for any heterogenous impacts in demographic groups most likely to bet on sports. Our methodology uses predicted counterfactual outcomes estimated using only the group of states that have not yet been treated to provide plausibly causal estimates of the impacts of access to sports betting. These results contradict the popular narrative of widespread mental harms associated with access to sports betting at the population average level, and provide important and timely evidence to an ongoing policy debate regarding the costs and benefits associated with legal sports betting.',\n",

I am summarizing the Report for the interested.\\n\\n[The Biden Doctrine: Reshaping Government Spending](https://www.strategicinsightsreport.com/p/biden-doctrine-reshaping-how-we-spend)\\n\\nThe Biden administration's economic policies have been misunderstood, according to a new report from Strategic Insights Report. Contrary to criticism of increased deficits and government expansion, the report finds that Biden's policies have given the economy time to heal, similar to Reagan's policies in the 1980s. Private spending as a percentage of GDP is now higher than it was under Reagan.\\n\\n**Key Findings**\\n\\n* The Biden administration's goal is not just more spending, but more spending at the federal level, which is a significant shift in power from state and local governments.\\n* The report finds that the federal government's share of total government spending has increased, while state and local spending has declined.\\n* Despite concerns about deficits, the report argues that the Biden administration has focused on recalibrating spending, directing funds towards specific areas of need rather than broad-based increases.\\n* The private sector has shown signs of robust activity, countering fears that government spending might crowd out private enterprise.\\n\\n**Economic Priorities**\\n\\n* The report concludes that the Biden administration has not led a complete economic catastrophe, with the economy growing and joblessness remaining low.\\n* However, there are concerns about tariffs, real wage growth, and deficits.\\n* The report suggests that the next administration will face challenges in balancing economic growth with concerns about income inequality and federal revenue.\\n\\n**State and Local Government Reform**\\n\\n* The report argues that the true fight will be at the state and local level, where deregulation and shifting power to states may be key issues.\\n* However, the report suggests that Trump's plans to shift power to states may be limited and unlikely to succeed in the short term.\\n\\n**Report Card**\\n\\n* The report concludes that Biden has done alright, with the economy on the mend and government spending less than it was under Trump in relative terms.\\n* However, the report criticizes Biden for not being communicative about the move to centralize and suggests that Kamala Harris should own the message and drive home why welfare programs need to be tightly controlled at the center.\\n\\nPS - ixed the link!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Snowflake Inc. gave a sales outlook that failed to reassure investors that the company will gain ground in the market for artificial intelligence software tools. The shares fell in extended traded.\\n\\nProduct revenue, which makes up the bulk of Snowflake’s business, will be $850 million to $855 million in the period ending in October, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, predicted $848 million, although some estimates exceeded $900 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its fiscal year product sales forecast to $3.36 billion from $3.3 billion.\\n\\nUnder Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has launched products focused on generative AI and other new ways to analyze large sets of data. The strategy is fueled in part by increased pressure from rivals including Databricks Inc. and cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Corp. Snowflake offers software that helps customers find, organize and use huge amounts of information from a variety of sources.\\n\\nRamaswamy touted “product delivery, and great traction in the early stages of our new AI products.”\\n\\nStill, Snowflake is navigating a challenging environment between a recent CEO change, security breaches of its customers and some market shift to products outside its traditional wheelhouse, wrote Derrick Wood, an analyst at TD Cowen, ahead of the results.\\n\\nIn the fiscal second quarter, total revenue rose 29% to $868.8 million — coming in under 30% for the first time in Snowflake’s history as a publicly traded company.\\n\\nThe shares declined about 7% in extended trading after closing at $135.06 in New York. The stock has dropped 32% this year, as investors have been concerned about Snowflake’s ability to catch up in AI-oriented tools.\\n\\nClients including AT&T Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s Ticketmaster and LendingTree Inc. had their Snowflake accounts breached as part of a hacking campaign beginning in May. Snowflake has said its own systems weren’t infiltrated and has added features for customers to implement better security settings.\\n\\n“We obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter,” Ramaswamy said of the customer breaches during a conference call after the results were released. “The issue wasn’t on the Snowflake side.”\\n\\nProduct revenue increased 30% to $829 million in the quarter, compared with the $813 million expected by analysts. Adjusted profit, excluding some items, was 18 cents a share, just ahead of the average estimate of 16 cents a share.\\n\\nSnowflake now has 510 customers that spent more than $1 million over a trailing 12-month period, up from 485 the previous quarter. Remaining performance obligations — another key benchmark of growth — were $5.2 billion in the period ended July 31, topping analysts’ average estimate of about $5 billion.\\n\\nThe company has added about 1,000 workers over the last year in a period when many peers were shedding employees or selectively hiring. Snowflake said it had 7,630 employees as of the second quarter.\\n\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-21/snowflake-outlook-fails-to-ease-investor-fears-of-competition',\n",

       "  'selftext': '**1. Pretend you’re smarter than the market.**\\xa0Investing is easy! Outsmarting the market isn’t that difficult! Surely, you’re more intelligent than the collective wisdom of millions of other investors.\\n\\nHow hard can it really be to beat the market?\\n\\n**2. Consistently try to time the market.**\\xa0Think and act in extremes. Go all in when it feels like the market is in a good place. Get out of the market when things seem dicey. Keep jumping in and out until you are rich.\\n\\nAnyone can do it.\\n\\n**3. Chase performance.**\\xa0Follow the hot hand. Invest with the star fund manager the financial media just fell in love with. Follow fads. Take tips on the hottest stocks.\\n\\nThere’s no luck involved in short-term outperformance. It’s all skill.\\n\\n**4. Fight the last war.**\\xa0Hedge the huge risk that just happened. Buy the Black Swan fund after the huge crash just occurred. Invest in that inflation hedge after prices have already skyrocketed. Make the decisions you wish you would have made before you lost money.\\n\\nDriving in the rearview mirror feels safe so it should work, right?\\n\\n**5. Take investment advice from billionaires.**\\xa0When billionaires go on financial television or share their thoughts on the markets or the economy they are talking directly to you. They know your financial circumstances, risk tolerance and time horizon. They follow the exact same investment strategy as you. They never change their minds or make statements to the financial press they don’t actually believe.\\n\\nWhat’s the harm in buying some puts just like George Soros or Stanley Druckenmiller?\\n\\nBillionaires are just like us!\\n\\n**6. Worry more about being right than making money.**\\xa0Who cares about your investment results? Intellectual superiority is where it’s at. You don’t need to worry about investment performance when you can complain about government debt levels, blame the Fed for doing away with free markets, and rail against politicians all day long.\\n\\nJust keep reading Zero Hedge. That oughta fix everything.\\n\\n**7. Benchmark your portfolio to the best-performing asset class.**\\xa0Who cares about diversification when there is always one asset class, strategy or sector outperforming?\\n\\nSpend your days second-guessing that you don’t have more money invested in the asset class with the best short-term performance. Then take all of your money and invest it in the best performer.\\n\\nSimply repeat this strategy over and over again.\\n\\nIt has to work eventually, correct?\\n\\n**8. Blame the Fed when you underperform.**\\xa0When you’re right it’s pure skill. When you’re wrong, it’s all the Fed’s fault.\\xa0 The system would have collapsed if it hadn’t been for Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen and Powell.\\n\\nDon’t worry about introspection following a bad prediction about the end of the financial system as we know it.\\n\\nYou’re not wrong just early.\\n\\n**9. Live and die by the short-run.**\\xa0No one has time for the long-run. The sure path to riches in the markets comes from following every economic data point, earnings release, headline, financial news story and insane social media conspiracy theory.\\n\\nYou need to stay on top of this stuff so you can react in real-time.\\n\\nIt’s not like the market prices this stuff in.\\n\\n**10. Sell all of your stocks in a bear market.**\\xa0Bear markets are far too painful to sit through. After stocks nosedive, sell your stocks and wait for the coast to clear.\\n\\nHow hard can it be to pick bottoms?\\n\\n**11. Assume you’re the next Warren Buffett.**\\xa0The guy is from Nebraska. Just memorize some of his folksy quotes and read a book or two about his investment style.\\n\\nPicking stocks is easy!\\n\\n**12. Overreact to market volatility.**\\xa0Volatility is scary. Panic. Change your portfolio. Abandon your asset allocation, diversification be damned.\\n\\nThere is no time for critical thinking. Act first, think later.\\n\\n**13. Be pessimistic about everything.**\\xa0Optimism is for gullible people. Everything is always bad. The world is falling apart.\\n\\nWhat’s the point of investing in a world that’s gone to hell?\\n\\n**14. Investing is boring. Just speculate!**\\xa0Trade zero-days options. Gamble. Shoot the moon. The markets are rigged anyway.\\n\\nWhy even try?\\n\\n**15. Try to become rich overnight.**\\xa0Forget your goals. Delayed gratification is for losers. Take as much risk as possible to create wealth in the shortest amount of time.\\n\\n by Ben Carlson',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'For the last 50 years, people have worked harder and harder for less and less. This is because that after we removed any measurable value (gold) from the dollar, it has fallen in purchasing power perpetually. Real inflation is no where close to the \"2%\" target and it hasn\\'t been for a long long time. \\n\\nKeynesian economics teaches that we need to expand and manipulate our money supply to have economic growth. People to this day are sadly convinced of this lie that if you don\\'t inflate the money that people wont spend it. Like somehow, we aren\\'t going to put food out our table of gas in our cars, or turn the heat on at night. \\n\\nIts no coincidence that governments loved the idea that they can inflate the money supply at some magic rate of 2% and funnel the stolen value from the economy to anyone they see fit. Anytime we counterfeit our money without adding value/production to the economy, it weakens the net worth of anyone holding dollars. \\n\\n2% is really just the amount of inflation that most people won\\'t notice. Its a perfect example of boiling frogs. \\n\\nIn a sound monetary system when no one has the power to print money, the money gets used for needs and not risky investments to keep your head above water as currency gets debased. War becomes rare because governments cannot fund it without the willingness of the people (who usually don\\'t want war)  and irresponsible government spending becomes literally impossible. Furthermore, when you have a static money supply in an economy that is producing more goods every day, said prices of goods naturally falls. This is literally everyone in an economy working for everyone in an economy instead everyone in an economy working for the central authority capable of debasing your money  \\n\\ni think identifying the problem is huge for the average person. We all feel our quality of life dropping, crime and poverty and homelessness rising. We need to wake up and see that the debasement of our currency we are forced to hold is destroying our livelihoods. \\n\\n',\n",

The expense ratios are the only difference, as the holdings of all three are nearly identical. SPLG actually has the lowest expense ratio of the three but for most of us who aren't investing in the millions- it won't really matter anyway. \\n\\nNote- Invesco, Charles Schwab, and JP Morgan Chase are a few other companies on the S&P 500 that offer similar ETFs.

My 100 shares are worth $10,000. \\n\\nI sell a covered call with a strike price of $101, for $0.20, so $20 for the contract.\\n\\nMy stock goes up to $101, I make $100 capital gains, plus I made $20 on the contract. \\n\\nBut I want the stock, and believe it will go up even higher, plus it yields dividends, so I’m willing to buy it back at $101.10 immediately, even though the market price is still $101.00. This way I pay $10,110 for the shares that I just sold for $10,100, but I made the $20 on the covered call, so I’m up $10. \\n\\nCan I create a chain of such sales and purchases to create passive income while maintaining my position on the stock? This seems great because my original investment was $10,000 and I wind up with something that is worth $10,100, plus the $10 profit from the whole transaction. \\n\\n*Forgive me if my verbiage is sub-par, I’m just getting into this stuff so I don’t have all the cool dickhead lingo down yet*',\n",

IOW they were slaves.\\n* Harris, who admits to smoking marijuana, continued to prosecute marijuana users.\\n* His book was on Amazon for 4 years but removed when Harris became the Democratic \"choice\"\\n* Her father, Donald Harris a Jamaican economist, denounced her 2020 campaign because of a slur about marijuana against all Jamaicans.\\n* She refused to allow DNA evidence in the trial of Kevin Cooper\\n* She supports mass incarceration and refused to prosecute Oakland Police for misconduct\\n* The Jacobins wore red hats during the 1848 French Revolution to bring down Feudalism which is why Red is now the color of revolution\\n* \"theaters\" were set up across Paris with naked women to inspire the revolutionaries\\n* the Chinese cultural revolution was about overthrowing feudalism\\n* George Soros also incites rage to push his color revolutions but to overthrow socialism\\n* the Chinese (and other governments) are quite conservative (ie no LGBTQ) because they are concerned with economic growth and in a society wracked by social instability this is difficult to accomplish\\n* during the Great Depression, the offer of stability (and bread) was very appealing to the working poor in the USA\\n* Harris appeals to stability rather than economic freedom (I know this sounds like a contradiction but to explain it further here would take forever, it has to do with being a chameleon and opportunistically changing her rhetoric.)\\n* Chaos protests were organized in 2020 (especially in Eugene Oregon) to gain support for the Democratic Party.  ie blame the chaos on Trump\\n* Harris will be a law and order President\\n* prosecution of the Uhuru movement as being Russian agents is an example\\n* the prosecution of the 6 Jan protestors is another example\\n* Trump would not be able to be \"law and order\" for many reasons\\n* Some history of the Communist Party and the beatings that took place in the \\'50s (which closely parallel what is happening to pro-Palestine supporters now)\\n* General condemnation of \"identity politics\".  He provides several examples about how political groups may argue with one another over certain policies but that they absolutely must stand together when the government begins to suppress any given one.\\n* Suggestion that the DHS has a covert organization dedicated to the infiltration of political groups that result in following identity politics and creation of conflict.\\n* And finally (at about 49 minutes) we get to the reason I\\'m posting this here.  It is about \"Bonapartism\".\\n* The \"working class\" is always suppressed\\n* What happens when the ruling class faces an economic crisis and begins to fight amongst itself?  This is \"Bonapartism\".\\n* This can result in Chaos\\n* Louis Bonapart arrested and suppressed many capitalists.  \\n* This is what FDR did (although perhaps not arrested)\\n* Reminds me (Maupin doesn\\'t bring it up) of Xi and Putin who are suppressing the capitalists but advancing their economies.\\n* However without a new struggle for civil liberties Bonapartism can result in Fascism and war.\\n* The American Economy is facing challenges from the BRICS and so authoritarianism is on the rise in the USA.\\n* Several minutes that remind me of Jackson Hinkel\\'s MAGA-communism which is to get \"leftists\" to talk to the Trumpers and begin to define common economic goals and put this social upheaval behind us.  \\n* \"Wokeism\" is a defeat for the Left\\n* Now that Biden has dropped out, wokeism is returning to the MSM.\\n* Social media is rigged.  \\n* Maupin was \"doxxed\" as a neo-Nazi.  We need to look past these false accusations.  Look at what has happened to Scott Ritter, Tulsi Gabbard and Richard Medhurst\\n* [Scott Ritter remembers Phil Donahue](https://consortiumnews.com/2024/08/20/scott-ritter-remembering-phil-donahue/)\\n* [Jordan Peterson is mentioned, as an aside, Richard Wolff was suppose to debate Peterson at a state college in Idaho.  Peterson backed out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hg3hdAUAPs&)\\n* [This clip is Wolff explaining how the feud between him and Peterson started.  It is hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU-AkeOyiOQ&t=6341s)\\n* Anyway, Maupin met Peter Coffin and dissuaded him from Peterson\\'s scrambled thinking.\\n* Maupin also has Reiner Shay misunderstand him.  They are now friends.\\n* Maupin is rejecting the communist label but remaining a Marxist.\\n* The interview ends when Maupin meets a Trumper on an airplane to Milwaukee and gets invited to his home for a BBQ.  Basically, \"we\\'re all in this together\" and \"why can\\'t we Just get along?\"',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"https://preview.redd.it/hmvwsxrvn0kd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aba0111370f8a7572a83bfbfc24bff0f512120d6\\n\\n***Photo above***\\xa0*- Could this work for me too? Just askin' . . .*  \\n  \\nI’d love to own $1 million in Bitcoin. I just don't want to bet $60,000 on it now (yesterdays closing price). However, I CAN afford to buy a 1 ounce Krugerrand coin, for $2,500. The prediction for THAT is $3,000 an ounce by next year. See links below.  \\n  \\nTo be fair, the Bitcoin fanboys are no longer predicting $1 million “in the next 12 months”. They used to say that all the time. The NEW prediction is $200,000 next year, and $500,000 shortly thereafter. That may sound less insane, but still - $200,000 is TRIPLE yesterday's closing price of $60,000. There were some nice gains in 2024 (so far). But that’s after falling to $17,000 in 2023, from a high of $60,000 a few months earlier.  \\n  \\nI doubt if gold is going to lose two thirds of its value in any given year. Unless they possibly find a way to send a spaceship up to that pure gold asteroid orbiting near Jupiter. That rock is supposedly worth $10 quintillion (a “1” with 16 zeros after it”). An excess supply of asteroid gold might cause the price of Krugerrands to crash. But still, I urge NASA to give this a shot. Some of the proceeds could be used to pay down our $35 Trillion national debt. Just bring back our astronauts from the ISS first. The Boeing Starliner has stranded them up there. It’s leaking hydrogen, and NASA has been trying to figure out why for almost 3 months. When it runs out of hydrogen, I imagine they will simply the Starliner into space, to free up the airlock for one of Musk’s “Dragon” SpaceX modules to rescue them. The Russians must be in hysterics over this. We can’t get our astronauts home until 2025, at the earliest.  \\n  \\n**Back to Bitcoin, and gold.**  \\n  \\nNeither of these “investments” pays a dividend or interest. But the similarity ends there. All your bitcoin could disappear if you lose your “key”, or if the electronic vault where you keep it gets hacked (billions are taken every year this way). With gold, you have a different array of risks. Fire at your home. Breaking and entering robbery. Someone pulls a gun and takes it from you enroute to some place. If you're prepping for Armageddon, you probably want a gun. The electricity will be off, and gold will flow to the people with the highest caliber pistols.  \\n  \\nFull disclosure – I’ve written multiple columns theorizing that Bitcoin is a scam. And it’s still going strong after 15 years, starting at a penny. I’ve written multiple columns expressing skepticism about gold too. And dissing the safety of America’s money center banks. And the super high DJIA index level.  \\n  \\nThe only thing I’m absolutely certain of is that land will beat all of these over the long term. If you doubt me, try to buy a home almost anywhere.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~Gold set for fresh highs ahead of Fed rate decision — analysts see prices at $3,000 by next year (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/gold-set-for-fresh-highs-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision-analysts-see-prices-at-3-000-by-next-year/ar-AA1p2hNq?ocid=BingNewsSerp)  \\n  \\n[**~Experts Forecast Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million Within A Decade Amid Crypto Boom (forbes.com)~**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/06/24/experts-forecast-bitcoin-to-hit-1-million-within-a-decade-amid-crypto-boom/)\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Macy’s cuts sales forecast as department stores struggle to draw shoppers ',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Macy’s cut its full-year sales forecast Wednesday, as the department store operator said it is contending with selective shoppers and more promotions.\\n\\nThe retailer posted a mixed quarter, as it topped Wall Street’s earnings expectations but missed on revenue.\\n\\nMacy’s said it now anticipates net sales of between $22.1 billion and $22.4 billion, which is lower than the $22.3 billion to $22.9 billion range it had previously anticipated. That also would be a year-over-year decline from the $23.09 billion it reported in fiscal 2023.\\n\\nMacy’s expects comparable sales, which take out the impact of store openings and closures, to range from a decrease of about 2% to a decline of about 0.5%. It had previously expected comparable sales to range from a decline of about 1% to a gain of 1.5%. That metric includes owned and licensed sales, which encompasses merchandise that Macy’s owns and items from brands that pay for space within its stores, along with Macy’s third-party online marketplace.\\n\\nThe department store operator said in a news release that the new outlook range “gives the flexibility to address the ongoing uncertainty in the discretionary consumer market.”\\n\\nHere’s what Macy’s reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: 53 cents adjusted vs. 30 cents expected\\n\\nRevenue: $4.94 billion vs. $5.12 billion expected\\n\\nShares fell about 8% in premarket trading.\\n\\nThe iconic department store is pushing to get back to steadier footing and sustained growth. Spring announced in February that the retailer would shutter about 150 – or nearly a third – of its namesake stores and invest in the roughly 350 locations that remain. It plans to close the locations by early 2027. \\n\\nIt is also opening new, smaller Macy’s stores in suburban strip malls and adding new locations of its better-performing brands, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury.\\n\\nYet Macy’s results in the recent quarter revealed its struggles to pull off that comeback at a time when consumers have been pickier about purchases – especially items that are wants rather than needs. \\n\\nNet sales fell from $5.13 billion in the year-ago period.\\n\\nThe namesake Macy’s brand continued to be the company’s weakest performer. Comparable sales fell 3.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including the third-party marketplace. \\n\\nAt Bloomingdale’s, comparable sales declined 1.4% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including the third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury comparable sales rose 2%, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth for the beauty brand.\\n\\nIn the three-month period that ended Aug. 3, Macy’s net income was $150 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with a loss of $22 million, or 8 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\nMacy’s stressed it has made progress in its turnaround plan, which it unveiled in February soon after Spring stepped into the company’s top role. At the first 50 of its stores to get additional investment, comparable sales were up 1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. It marked the second consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales at those stores since the plan started.\\n\\nYet even when excluding the weaker stores that Macy’s is shutting, sales were lackluster. Comparable sales for its go-forward namesake brand – which includes the Macy’s stores that will remain open and online sales – declined 3.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including the third-party marketplace. \\n\\nAlong with a choppy sales environment, Macy’s leaders had also faced a bid by an activist group to take the company private. Macy’s said last month that its board had unanimously decided to end negotiations with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital.\\n\\nShares of Macy’s closed on Tuesday at $17.74, bringing the company’s market cap to $4.9 billion. As of Tuesday’s close, the company’s stock is down about 12% so far this year. That trails behind the approximately 17% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/macys-m-q2-2024-earnings.html',\n",

       "  'title': 'Target beats on earnings and revenue, but gives cautious sales outlook for the year  ',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Target said Wednesday that sales grew about 3% in its fiscal second quarter, a return to growth after a prolonged stretch of sluggish sales and squeezed profits.\\n\\nThe discounter beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations, as shoppers made more visits to Target’s stores and website and bought more discretionary items like clothing.\\n\\nEven so, the company stuck by its previous full-year sales forecast and struck a cautious note. Target said it expects comparable sales for the full year to range from flat to up 2%, but said it now expects the increase will likely be in the lower half of the range. \\n\\nTarget raised its profit guidance, however, saying it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $9 to $9.70, up from the previous range of $8.60 and $9.60.\\n\\nShares rose more than 10% in premarket trading as Target showed improvement in generating profits.\\n\\nOn a call with reporters, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke said Target took a “measured approach” with its outlook because it’s hard to predict consumers’ mindsets and the state of the economy in the coming months.\\n\\n“While we’ve been pleased with our performance so far this year, and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high,” he said.\\n\\nHere’s what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: $2.57 vs. $2.18 expected\\n\\nRevenue: $25.45 billion vs. $25.21 billion expected\\n\\nTarget, known for its wide array of trendy but low-priced merchandise, has been hurt as consumers buy fewer items like new outfits or home decor while they pay more for everyday expenses like food and housing. The big-box retailer has also struggled with reduced profits in recent quarters, as customers bought items like groceries that tend to be lower margin, and losses from damaged inventory and theft, including organized retail crime, took a toll.\\n\\nThose trends improved in the second quarter, as Target attracted shoppers with new merchandise and reduced prices.\\n\\nTarget’s net income jumped to $1.19 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $835 million, or $1.80 per share, in the year-ago quarter. That’s a more than 40% year-over-year increase.\\n\\nTotal revenue rose from $24.77 billion in the prior year.\\n\\nComparable sales rose 2% in the quarter, the first time in five quarters that Target posted a gain. The industry metric tracks sales online and at stores open at least 13 months.\\n\\nDigital sales drove most of those gains, growing 8.7% in the quarter, as more customers used same-day services like curbside pickup and home delivery. Comparable store sales rose slightly, up 0.7%.\\n\\nTarget has tried to rev up sales and drive higher foot traffic by deepening loyalty and offering discounts. The company relaunched its loyalty program early this year and introduced a new paid membership, Target Circle 360, that includes perks like free same-day deliveries. Target threw its own sales event in July to compete with Amazon’s Prime Day. And it announced in May that it would cut prices on about 5,000 frequently bought items, including diapers, milk and paper towels. \\n\\nCEO Brian Cornell said customers have responded well to the price cuts and credited them for contributing to traffic growth in the quarter. \\n\\nCustomer traffic across Target’s website and store grew 3% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. The average size of customers’ shopping baskets, however, declined slightly, Fiddelke said.\\n\\nDiscretionary sales, which have been under pressure across the retail industry, improved. Target said apparel sales, for instance, grew more than 3% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. \\n\\nBack-to-school has also been an important season for the retailer. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a call with reporters that the shopping season has matched Target’s expectations, as many customers gravitate toward items with good value like backpacks that cost $5 and crayons that cost 25 cents. \\n\\nHe said back-to-college shopping tends to be a longer season, as students gradually decorate their apartments and dorms.\\n\\nShares of Target closed on Tuesday at $144.33. As of Tuesday’s close, the company’s stock is up about 1% so far this year. That’s trailed behind the S&P 500′s approximately 17% gains during the same period.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.html',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Alphabet has the best 'value' benchmark among the Magnificent 7 from earning multiple perspective. Accordingly to past financial reports since '22, Alphabet has been dedicating almost 100% of its free cash flow in share buyback. \\n\\nThe number is huge considering that its net income in '22 is $60B, $73.8B for '23, and trailing 4 quarters is at $87.7B. Share buyback amounted to $59B, $62B, and most recently $63B.\\n\\nAlphabet uses free cash flow calculation as derived by \\\\[Cash flow from operation minus purchases in plants & equipment\\\\]. Numbers are compiled at [http://gotrader.xyz/](http://gotrader.xyz/)\\n\\nConsidering that we're now in the accelerated AI era since the launch of killer app ChatGPT back in late 22, there appears to be no slowing in share buyback. I was curious given the lackluster spending of AI equipment, since protecting Alphabet's moat (i.e., dominant position in search) is more important than share buyback.\\n\\nTake a look at investing cash flow. It's hovering at some $20B annually. One can presume these expenses are inclusive of its custom TPU accelerators (all other major tech companies use Nvidia's). Why don't Alphabet spend more on TPU purchases?\\n\\nWhat do you think?\",\n",

I just went back to serving tables in my hometown because tipped pay is better than hourly, only to find that, despite the increase in cost of the restaurant between 2021 to now, my weekly bank deposits almost exactly match my 2021 deposits because people are simply tipping smaller percentages on larger bills! That doesn\\'t happen if everyone has more money, as the \"higher real wages\" would suggest! \\n\\nWhat the hell is going on with that statistic that gets thrown around but doesn\\'t seem to be relevant or true when it comes to 99% of the people I see with my own two eyes in the real world?

Here's my previous:\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1euizoo/american\\\\_healthcare\\\\_reit\\\\_ahr\\\\_increased\\\\_senior/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web3x&utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\\\_term=1&utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1euizoo/american_healthcare_reit_ahr_increased_senior/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\\n\\nI previously tried to simplify the positive future outlook and performance of this recently public healthcare REIT through my own logical assumptions but frankly the company itself puts the quantitative growth in the near future that much more promising. As a dividend stock that is just making its early beginnings in the market and finding it's proper evaluation - think it is facing a catalyst of growth with the rate cuts, the recovery of healthcare real estate from the high level of interest and the growing age of America.\\n\\n[https://ir.americanhealthcarereit.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx](https://ir.americanhealthcarereit.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx)\\n\\nThis morning Bank of America raised its PT to $27/sh shortly after breaking the $19 previously broken last week. Currently the majority of analyst ratings match to a buy rating for this REIT that went public in February and has only had positive growth since then, increased dividends and the way I see it will be my long and hopeful chunk of the real estate portion of my portfolio.\\n\\n[https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-boosts-american-healthcare-reit-stock-target-keeps-buy-rating-93CH-3579703](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-boosts-american-healthcare-reit-stock-target-keeps-buy-rating-93CH-3579703)\\n\\nEconomists estimate multiple cuts before the end of the year with Powell unloading possibly the details of what will occur in September this week and this could prime the company for steadily ramped up expansion in the coming year.\\n\\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-fast-and-how-far-could-the-fed-cut-rates-powell-may-give-hint-during-friday-speech](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-fast-and-how-far-could-the-fed-cut-rates-powell-may-give-hint-during-friday-speech)\\n\\nI'll be back in November before the 3rd (?) cut.  Healthcare REITs have taken a hit the last 3 years with a decline and I'm eyeballing some safe real estate options with the turn of the probable influx of loaning and spending - but I feel the chances of a good turn-around for this sector on top of the under-evaluation it is experiencing will bring this up as a solid investment for the institutions soon.\",\n",

In addition, they lost an average of 22.9 percent of their body weight, compared with 2.1 percent in the placebo group. These data further confirm the potential clinical benefit of long-term treatment for patients with obesity and prediabetes.\\n\\nAlthough tirzepatide is relatively new to the market (first approved in 2022), it's already a profitable drug. Last year, it generated $5.34 billion in sales. This year, it's on track to reach nearly $18 billion in sales!\\n\\nLilly's stock is closely tied to the company's efforts to expand the use of tirzepatide. The company is testing the efficacy of tirzepatide for a variety of conditions thought to be caused by obesity, including heart disease, sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\nNearly 900 million adults worldwide are at risk for complications from obesity.\\n\\nEli Lilly also advocates long-term use of tizepatide. During a 17-week follow-up period, patients stopped treatment and some began to regain weight and develop type 2 diabetes. This resulted in an overall 88% reduction in the risk of developing diabetes.\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Lowe's cuts full-year outlook as it expects weaker home improvement sales \",\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Lowe’s on Tuesday cut its full-year forecast, as the retailer’s quarterly sales declined and it projected weak home improvement spending in the second half of the year.\\n\\nThe company said it now projects total sales of between $82.7 billion and $83.2 billion for the full year, compared with the $84 billion to $85 billion that it previously expected. It said it expects comparable sales to fall by 3.5% to 4%, compared with its prior forecast of a decline of 2% to 3%. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will be about $11.70 to $11.90, compared with the prior outlook of between $12 and $12.30.\\n\\nIn an interview with CNBC, CEO Marvin Ellison said consumers are waiting for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He added shoppers also under pressure from the economic backdrop.\\n\\n“Inflation remains high,” he said. “And big-ticket purchases are being delayed as customers sit back and wait for interest rates to fall.”\\n\\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a rate cut could come as soon as September, but Ellison said it’s difficult to predict how soon home improvement activity would gain momentum again after that.\\n\\nAbout 90% of Lowe’s customers are homeowners and most have a fixed 30-year mortgage rate of less than 4%, he said. That explains customers’ hesitance to get a new mortgage or take out a loan for a major home project with higher interest rate, he added.\\n\\nHe said Lowe’s has not seen “a dramatic shift one way or another in overall consumer sentiment,” but is waiting for housing turnover to go up.\\n\\nHere’s what the company reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: $4.10 adjusted vs. $3.97 expected\\n\\nRevenue: $23.59 billion vs. $23.91 billion expected\\n\\nIn the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, Lowe’s net income fell to $2.38 billion, or $4.17 per share, compared with $2.67 billion, or $4.56 per share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\nLowe’s got a $43 million pretax gain from the sale of its Canadian retail business in 2022, which lifted its earnings in the second quarter. That boosted the company’s earnings per share in the period by 7 cents. Excluding the gain, the company earned $4.10 per share.\\n\\nNet sales dropped from $24.96 billion in the prior year. Lowe’s posted a year-over-year sales decline for the sixth straight quarter.\\n\\nComparable sales, an industry metric that takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, dropped 5.1%, as the company said customers took on fewer discretionary home projects and unfavorable weather hurt sales of outdoor and seasonal items. It said those declines were partially offset by growth in its online business and sales to home professionals, such as contractors and electricians.\\n\\nLowe’s shared its quarterly results and outlook at a time when investors and economists are watching consumer spending particularly closely. Recent economic data and corporate earnings have given mixed indications about American households’ financial health, as the Federal Reserve weighs a much-awaited rate cut.\\n\\nJobs growth in July came in much lower than expected. Yet on the other hand, Walmart’s CFO, John David Rainey, told CNBC that the largest U.S. retailer does not “see any additional fraying of consumer health.” Goldman Sachs also cut the odds of a recession to 20%.\\n\\nFor home improvement retailers, the strain may be greater because of higher mortgage rates and elevated costs for borrowing. Lowe’s rival, Home Depot, last week beat Wall Street’s quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue. Yet the company said it expects the back half of the year to be weaker than anticipated as consumers continue to have a “deferral mindset.”\\n\\nIn an interview with CNBC, Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said customers are not only putting off projects because of higher interest rates. He said they also have “a sense of greater uncertainty in the economy,” even though most of Home Depot’s customers own homes and have seen sharp property value gains.\\n\\nShares of Lowe’s closed Monday at $243.21. As of Monday’s close, the company’s stock is up about 9% year to date, trailing behind the nearly 18% gains of the S&P 500.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/lowes-low-q2-2024-earnings.html',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.\\n\\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\\n\\nThe computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.\\n\\n“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.\\n\\nThe addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.\\n\\n“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.\\n\\nAMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.\\n\\nAMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.\\n\\nZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.\\n\\nThe closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.\\n\\nExecutives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.\\n\\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\\n\\nAMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/amd-to-acquire-server-builder-zt-systems.html',\n",

It will be there for 99 years. Think of a garden shed from Home Depot, with water, sewer, electricity, and cable.*  \\n  \\nOkay, I’m a renter, NOT a homeowner. But even if I did own, I wouldn’t sign up for this. Give up half my back yard for a renter I have no control over? For 99 years? Get real. I’d probably shoot the guy way before the first year was up. (Lyrics to\\xa0**“99 Year Blues”**\\xa0by Hot Tuna*: “Get me my pistol and 3 round balls/gonna shoot everybody I don’t like at all.*”)  \\n  \\nIf you DO sign up, don’t worry. You won’t personally need to apply for the permits, supervise the construction, or collect the rent. Some company is going to do all that for you. Plus the maintenance. The company will pay Mr. and Mrs. Lucky Homeowner $500 a month to lease their back yard for this Home Depot Garden Shed with a potty. See link at bottom.  \\n  \\nStill, if you need a quick $500, it might be enticing. $500 a month. $6,000 a year. You could buy a LOT of groceries with that.  \\n  \\nThis year. I’m sorry to report, that due to the effect of inflation, the initial $500 a month will only be worth $250 a month in 10 years. Maybe even less, maybe even faster.  \\n  \\nAs I’m writing this, there’s an ad on TV for “Diamond Equity”. We buy homes in any condition. Do you want to sell your home fast? Problem tenants? Or just tired of paying your mortgage. . .. ? Will they buy MY tiny home if I have problem lodgers in the shed out back, which I have no legal right to control?  \\n  \\nAnd what’s my mortgage company going to say about a 99-year lease to low-income homeless folks on THEIR property? Technically, they own it until the mortgage is paid in full. I would need to get out my 99-page mortgage agreement. Given this was drafted by bank lawyers, they might have actually remembered to put a clause in which \"prohibits outbuildings to be used for tenants, day care, dog fighting, or industrial purposes\".  \\n  \\nAnd that tiny house could be a real conversation starter with the next-door neighbor you hardly see:\\xa0*“WTF??? You have some crackhead living in your garden shed?”*\\xa0(Yes, but I’m getting $500 a month for this. Ignore my tenant when he gawks over the fence at your teen daughter in your swimming pool. He’s harmless. I think. The company that built the shed interviewed him before leasing. Anyway, I’m sorry he keeps parking his truck in front of YOUR house instead of mine. I’ll speak to him about that again.)  \\n  \\nThe company that envisions these occupied garden sheds will have to swordfight with the local zoning commission to get permits.

       "  'selftext': 'A need for a wealth tax is morally justified. As a redistribution of wealth from those who have too much, to those who have too little. It can also be politically and economically justified according to utilitarian principles. That one dollar in the hands of those who are poor, go much further than one dollar in the hands of one ultra rich. But a wealth tax cannot be justified under meritocratic or libertarian principles.\\n\\nAccording to Gaurdian: \"The Tax Justice Network said applying a similar tax on the top 0.5% wealthiest households worldwide, at a rate of between 1.7% and 3.5%, would raise about $2.1tn. The study excluded some exemptions in the Spanish tax – including for shares in listed companies, intellectual property and industrial property, and some high-value assets such as boats and aircraft.\"\\n\\nI think a lower wealth tax, at about 0.5 % would be more politically acceptable, while a tax above 2% is too high. The one time windfall, of say a 1% tax or global tax of about USD 1 trillion won\\'t last. At most it will fund climate change mitigation and adaptation for only one year. What is more important is a recurring tax on wealth gains. Combined with the one time wealth tax. Wealth gains for the richest can be taxed at a much higher rate, like 25% to 50%. \\n\\nReference: https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/aug/19/wealth-tax-on-super-rich-could-raise-15tn-globally-campaigners-say',\n",

       "  'selftext': '**1.0 Introduction**\\n\\nChegg ($CHGG) began as a textbook rental service,\\xa0***a*****iming to reduce the high costs of purchasing textbooks**. Over time, it evolved into a company that offers\\xa0**a**\\xa0**range of educational services and tools**.\\n\\nThe education system has plenty of flaws, creating demand for individuals and companies to assist in understanding a certain topic. There are plenty of amazing sources of knowledge, ranging from\\xa0*Coursera*\\xa0and\\xa0*edX*\\xa0to\\xa0*Udacity*\\xa0and even\\xa0*YouTube*. However, they\\xa0**do not offer a solution to the homework**, but rather an understanding of a certain topic.\\n\\nThis is where Chegg comes in. Its primary business is\\xa0**selling students monthly subscriptions for homework help.**\\xa0So, is Chegg a\\xa0***net positive***\\xa0for society?\\n\\n**Although it can be used for learning, I’d argue that it is an organization that supports academic dishonesty and acts as a cheating database for homework.**\\n\\nSome universities request data from Chegg to monitor their students and prevent cheating during exams. Chegg provides this information, including\\xa0*activity timestamps, IP addresses,*\\xa0and\\xa0*email details*, which universities use to identify and suspend students involved in misconduct.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2.0 The pandemic surge & the beginning of the end**\\n\\nAs expected, Chegg benefited from the pandemic, and the number of subscribers doubled between 2019 and 2021 (from 3.9 million to 7.8 million).\\n\\nHowever, the beginning of the end has started, and it can be best illustrated through the following 5 points:\\n\\n\\n\\n**2.1 The competitive landscape is significantly different**\\n\\nGiven the alternatives that exist today for solving homework problems, it is unlikely that the company will return to its growing days.\\n\\nChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, although the revenue decline already started in Q2-2022. Based on the last quarterly report (Q2-2024), the revenue is\\xa0**declining at a rate of 10% per year.** Its revenue is down from $776m back in 2021, to $683m for the last twelve months (ending June 2024).\\n\\nIt is not only ChatGPT, there’s\\xa0*Caktus AI, Jenni AI, Numerade, Photomath, Course Hero, and many more.*\\n\\nGoogle Trends paints a great picture of how the demand for Chegg has changed in the last 5 years.\\n\\n  \\n**2.2**\\xa0**Being profitable is a challenge**\\n\\nExcept for the pandemic period, the company is struggling to find its way to operating profitability, despite the \\\\~70% gross margin. If we add up the operating profit / (loss) of the last 7 years (*which includes the pandemic boost*), the company broke even.\\n\\nWith more competitors, lower demand, and decreasing revenue, it is difficult to make a case that Chegg is a company that will turn things around. It appears that Chegg’s best days are behind it, and the only way to survive longer - is by cutting costs.\\n\\nBack in April, the company announced Nathan Schultz as the new CEO, and a restructuring plan was shared with the public. Part of the plan was reducing its global headcount by 23% which will lead to\\xa0**$40-$50m**\\xa0in savings as of 2025. This is a great decision when facing declining revenue. However, on its own, it is not enough to create long-term shareholder value. It is unclear how the management plans to reinvent the company with fewer employees.\\n\\n  \\n**2.3 Poor capital allocation**\\n\\nThe previous management has a terrible record in capital allocation.\\n\\nWe can best illustrate that through the balance sheet of the company between the end of 2017, and June 2024:\\n\\n||December 2017|June 2024|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Cash, short-term, and long-term investments|$229m|$605m|\\n|Debt|$0|$617m|\\n|Net cash|$229|-$11|\\n|Shares outstanding|110m|104m|\\n\\nDespite generating \\\\~$1.3 billion in operating cash flow in this period, the company’s net cash position has decreased by $240m.\\n\\nSo, where did this\\xa0**\\\\~$1.5 billion go to?**\\n\\n1. Acquisitions -\\xa0**$600 million**\\xa0(Busuu, Mathway, Thinkful, StudyBlue, WriteLab, Math42)\\n2. Capex -\\xa0**$550 million**\\n3. Share buybacks (net of issuance) -\\xa0**$200 million**\\n\\nIn Q2-2024, the company reported\\xa0**$481m in impairments**\\xa0(mostly in goodwill) - meaning they significantly overpaid for the past acquisitions, especially Busuu\\xa0*(acquired for $436m).*\\n\\n\\n\\n**2.5**\\xa0**Terrible reviews**\\n\\nThe reviews of the company have been terrible. (Source: Trustpilot)\\n\\nRecently, there have been more accusations of customers with difficulties canceling their memberships or having been charged multiple times after they canceled the subscription. The revenue the company reported is likely somewhat inflated and will continue to decrease in the quarters to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3.0 Valuation**\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, Chegg is a company with decreasing revenue and a low chance of finding a way to grow and become profitable. With that in mind, the value of the company is its liquidation value (which\\xa0**IS NOT**\\xa0its book value).\\n\\nBased on my estimates, its liquidation value is around \\\\~$160m (not that far from its market cap of $212m). Therefore, I do think the market is not expecting it to be a turnaround story.\\n\\n**Could the market be wrong?**\\xa0Of course!\\n\\n1. Given the competitive landscape and the 23% employee reduction, as mentioned above, I struggle to envision a path, where the company reinvents itself and increases the number of subscribers. However, there is always a chance that a miracle happens, despite this chance being very low. With the restructuring plan in place, at least the company can survive for many years to come.\\n2. The company could get acquired for its customer base. The typical acquisition premium is around 20%, so the 7.7 million subscribers would have an average price of \\\\~**$33**. I do think acquisition is a more likely scenario than bankruptcy.\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Did Florida home prices REALLY drop 40% this year? (Reality Check)',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"https://preview.redd.it/m1mntxdf8fjd1.jpg?width=251&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51776826426568144e60b9484101ae0bd0596898\\n\\n***Photo above***\\xa0*- good for parts! (if you act fast). Cars on the North Shore of Oahu can rust to pieces before your loan is paid off. Now the same thing is happening to high rise buildings in Miami. Prices are falling.*  \\n  \\nEveryone wants lower home prices, right? Well maybe not if you already own a home, and are trying to sell. Especially if your mortgage loan still has a big balance. According to the link below (London Daily Mail) Florida condos have dropped 40% in price. The reporter is some UK guy named “Miles Dilworth” (his real name, not a joke). Miles lives in New York City, not Florida. But that doesn’t automatically make Miles one of the 88% of journalists which opinion polls show are NOT trusted by people.  \\n  \\nHowever, unlike “Miles”, I actually DO live in Florida. And I can tell you that there are some condos listed near me (greater Tampa area) but they’re NOT on sale at 40% off. I suspect the big price drops are happening in places like Miami. Or moving up the coast, other geezer-attractant cities like Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.  \\n  \\nThe problem isn’t global warming – yet. It’s decades of mismanagement of condos by their owners associations. These units are largely occupied by geezers (and investors) who assumed they would die (or sell the unit) sooner rather than later, so they NEVER voted to increase their condo fees for proper maintenance. Hence, a crisis related to breezy salt air. Steel girders and concrete pilings are rotting away. It will cost millions to fix these problems. In some cases the damage is too far gone to be fixed.  \\n  \\nAdditionally, the insurance industry says it has been underpricing disaster insurance. Hurricanes and flooding. Ignore the fact that there’s no spike in hurricanes, and the peak was evidently a century ago. The insurers are probably still right. Their rates aren’t high enough to cover the cost when these towers in the sand start to topple over.  \\n  \\nThere’s not much chatter about gulf cities like Tampa, St. Petersburg, Sarasota. But we have plenty of salty air driven by the breeze too. Condo prices aren’t down 40% yet, but when the insurance and condo fees keep rising, who knows?  \\n  \\nIf you’re smirking because you DON’T live in Florida, please stop. California, I’m looking at you. You also have rust and concrete erosion. Not to mention earthquakes, brushfires (some by arson) and cliffside homes simply falling into the sea. California auto insurance rates went up 30% over the past 12 months. A similar hike is expected next year. Insurers are fleeing the state because they don’t get along with the state regulators. When auto insurers flee, they usually shutter their property-casualty divisions as well. Fewer insurers means less competition which means higher insurance premiums. That old supply/demand equation again, dammit !! Perhaps socialism can fix this? (Just kidding.)  \\n  \\nI don’t want to be an alarmist, but eventually Florida WILL sink beneath the waves, like it was 23 million years ago. That’s why nobody ever finds dinosaur fossils in Florida, except possibly in a gift shop. Planet Earth normally doesn’t have polar ice caps and glaciers. When there's no ice and snow places like Florida are submerged. Those ice caps started melting 20,000 years ago and will continue to do so whether you dive a Tesla or a Toyota. Nothing can stop it.  \\n  \\nBut that’s NOT a reason to sell your Florida condo. Instead, sell it because of salt air corrosion. This is a self-inflicted wound by geezers who won't vote for condo maintenance, or school taxes, or any other kind of taxes. They think it's 1930.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~Florida hit by 'worst real estate crisis in decades' (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/finance-real-estate/florida-hit-by-worst-real-estate-crisis-in-decades/ar-AA1oXv6u?ocid=BingNewsSerp)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'when stock go down, the wealth effect goes away, people spend less money, economy slows, the market going down has triling affects and the fed comes to rescue it, the fed basically indirectly rescues the stock market because their job is to keep a stable economy\\n\\n# ChatGPT zei:\\n\\nChatGPT\\n\\nYou\\'re describing a sequence of events that is often observed in the economy when stock markets experience significant declines, a phenomenon that reflects how intertwined financial markets and economic activity are. Here\\'s a breakdown of the process:\\n\\n# 1. Stock Market Decline and the Wealth Effect\\n\\n* **Wealth Effect**: When stock prices rise, investors feel wealthier, even if they don\\'t sell their assets. This perceived increase in wealth often leads to higher consumer spending, as people feel more confident in their financial situation.\\n* When stock prices fall, the reverse happens. Investors feel less wealthy, which can reduce consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items like cars, homes, and luxury goods. This reduction in spending can slow down economic growth, as consumer spending is a significant driver of the economy.\\n\\n# 2. Economic Slowdown\\n\\n* As consumer spending declines, businesses may see lower revenues, which can lead to reduced production, layoffs, and a decrease in investment. This can create a feedback loop where the economy slows further due to reduced demand and income.\\n* A slowing economy often leads to lower corporate earnings, which can depress stock prices even more, exacerbating the initial downturn.\\n\\n# 3. Federal Reserve\\'s Role\\n\\n* The Federal Reserve (or \"the Fed\") has a mandate to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. In practice, this often means the Fed takes actions to support the economy during downturns.\\n* When the economy slows significantly, the Fed may intervene by lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment, or by implementing other monetary policies such as quantitative easing to inject liquidity into the financial system.\\n* While the Fed\\'s primary goal isn\\'t to support the stock market directly, its actions to stabilize the economy often have the side effect of bolstering financial markets. For instance, lower interest rates make equities more attractive relative to bonds, potentially leading to a stock market recovery.\\n\\n# 4. The Fed\\'s Indirect Impact on the Stock Market\\n\\n* By stabilizing the economy, the Fed indirectly supports the stock market. Investors often anticipate Fed actions and may adjust their portfolios in response to expected policy moves, which can drive market movements.\\n* Additionally, a more stable economy leads to higher corporate profits over time, which can support higher stock prices.\\n\\n# 5. The Feedback Loop\\n\\n* There\\'s a complex feedback loop where economic conditions influence the stock market, and vice versa. When the Fed steps in to support the economy, the effects can reverberate through the stock market, consumer confidence, and economic activity, often leading to a recovery in both the economy and the stock market.\\n\\nIn summary, while the Fed\\'s primary goal isn\\'t to rescue the stock market, its efforts to maintain economic stability often have the indirect effect of supporting the stock market, particularly during times of economic stress. This interconnectedness between the economy and financial markets is a fundamental aspect of modern economic systems.\\n\\n4o\\n\\n# Je zei:\\n\\nif we look at the effect of reflexivity, every time markets have went down, they have went back up, this means that reflexivity is here too, more and more people buy the dip\\n\\n# ChatGPT zei:\\n\\nChatGPT\\n\\nYou\\'re touching on a concept known as **reflexivity**, which was popularized by investor and philosopher George Soros. Reflexivity suggests that market participants\\' perceptions can influence market realities, creating feedback loops that can drive markets in particular directions, sometimes away from what would be expected based on fundamentals alone. Here’s how this concept applies to the idea that markets tend to recover after downturns:\\n\\n# 1. Reflexivity and Market Perception\\n\\n* In financial markets, the actions of participants are not just reactions to reality; they also help shape that reality. For example, if investors believe that a market downturn is temporary and that prices will recover, they may \"buy the dip,\" expecting to profit when prices rise again.\\n* This collective belief can drive prices back up, reinforcing the idea that markets recover after downturns. This is reflexivity in action: the belief that the market will recover leads to actions that actually help the market recover.\\n\\n# 2. Market Cycles and Recovery\\n\\n* Historically, financial markets have demonstrated a tendency to recover from downturns over time. This is partly due to underlying economic growth, central bank interventions, and the natural tendency of economies to grow over the long term.\\n* Reflexivity adds another layer to this recovery: as more investors buy into the idea that markets will rebound, they contribute to the rebound itself. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the expectation of recovery drives the actual recovery.\\n\\n# 3. Buying the Dip\\n\\n* The phrase \"buying the dip\" refers to purchasing assets when their prices have fallen, with the expectation that they will rise again. This behavior is often driven by the belief that downturns are temporary and that markets will eventually return to previous highs.\\n* When many investors adopt this strategy, it can accelerate the market\\'s recovery. As prices start to rise, more investors may jump in, fearing they’ll miss the opportunity to buy at lower prices, which can further drive up prices.\\n\\n# 4. Positive Feedback Loop\\n\\n* Reflexivity creates a positive feedback loop: investors believe markets will recover, so they buy; their buying pushes prices up, which then reinforces the belief that markets recover after downturns. This can sometimes lead to rapid recoveries following sharp declines.\\n* However, reflexivity can also work in the opposite direction during downturns, where negative sentiment can exacerbate declines. But historically, the market has shown resilience, often recovering and reaching new highs after periods of decline.\\n\\n# 5. Long-Term Trends\\n\\n* Over the long term, markets tend to reflect the underlying growth of economies, corporate earnings, and innovation. Despite short-term volatility, these long-term trends usually drive markets higher over time.\\n* Reflexivity plays a role in amplifying these trends, as market participants’ beliefs and actions can accelerate both downturns and recoveries.\\n\\n# 6. Caveats and Risks\\n\\n* While reflexivity suggests that markets tend to recover, it’s important to note that this is not guaranteed in every situation. Markets can stay depressed for extended periods, and recoveries can be uneven. Economic fundamentals, geopolitical events, and other factors can impact the timing and strength of any recovery.\\n* Reflexivity can also lead to bubbles, where prices rise far beyond fundamental values due to positive feedback loops, which can eventually result in sharp corrections.\\n\\nIn summary, reflexivity contributes to the phenomenon where markets often recover after downturns because the collective belief in recovery drives actions that make recovery more likely. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where \"buying the dip\" becomes a common strategy, helping to propel markets back up after declines. However, while this pattern has held historically, it’s not without risks, and market participants must remain aware of the broader economic context.',\n",

The elderly care industry was especially hard hit because it is a labor intensive industry.\\xa0 NHC was forced to extensively use expensive staffing agencies & traveling nurses to fill vacancies.\\n\\nOccupancy rates and labor balance are only now starting to approach pre-2020 baseline levels.\\xa0 Because of this, the stock price has already increased sharply.\\xa0 I first wrote about NHC [here in April 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bspx41/increasing_dementia_will_be_a_long_term_boon_for/).\\xa0 Since then, the price has increased by 38% in 4 months.\\xa0 But there are still multiple factors and trends that will improve margins and accelerate earnings growth.\\n\\n**1. The labor situation will continue to improve**\\n\\nGoldman Sachs estimates that the net immigration rate to the United States is currently +160K/month or +2 million/year.\\xa0 Many of these new immigrants will compete for entry level positions like housekeeper and caregiver, which will decrease wage pressure and turnover.\\xa0 Also, nursing shortages are continuing to ease.\\xa0 Nursing job postings on Indeed are down [30% from 2022 peak levels](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPNURS).\\xa0 NHC reported a 57% year on year (YoY) decrease in staffing agency utilization.\\xa0 Traveling nurses are incredibly expensive and NHC will continue to see a decreasing need for them.\\xa0 NHC reported a net YoY total salaries/wages increase of only 2.7% in the most recent quarter.\\xa0 It’s reasonable to expect that YoY changes in total salaries/wages will continue to decrease.\\n\\n**2. Occupancy and Demand will continue to increase**\\n\\nOccupancy rates at NHC are 89%, which is very near pre-2020 baseline levels of around 90%.\\xa0 But occupancy rate will likely continue to increase and exceed 90% in the coming quarters because there is an increasing supply & demand imbalance of senior living facilities including SNFs.\\xa0 Because of the 2020-2023 headwinds, intensive construction of senior living facilities stopped.\\xa0 Meanwhile, demographic changes continue as the first baby boomers approach 80 years old.\\xa0 Increasing occupancy & demand will not only increase resident volume, it will allow NHC to become more selective and allow them to select the more profitable Medicare and Privately insured residents.\\n\\n**3. Insurance reimbursement rates will continue to increase**\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nBecause of the current and projected demand increases, insurance has been forced to increase reimbursement rates.\\xa0 Before 2020, Medicare’s annual rate increase was normally around 2%.\\xa0 In July 2023, Medicare announced a rate increase of 4.0%.\\xa0 In July 2024 they announced another 4.2% increase that will take effect in October of this year.\\xa0 Annual Medicaid increases were sometimes below 1% pre-2020.\\xa0 NHC recently reported its 2024 YTD Medicaid reimbursement rates have already increased 5.0%.\\xa0 And new, significant Medicaid increases started in July for Tennessee and South Carolina.\\xa0 These increases will contribute to earnings in upcoming quarters.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion and positions**\\n\\nFor the most recent quarter, NHC reported normalized earnings growth of 12.4% vs Q2 2023.\\xa0 I think that earnings growth is likely to accelerate in coming quarters.\\xa0 I'd appreciate any feedback.

       "  'selftext': \"I came up with this in a short time - I'm looking for some more experienced investors to give me the negatives and possible counter points to weigh this long term. If I'm being too narrow-minded/shallow please let me know.\\n\\nAmerican Healthcare REIT (AHR) is a Real Estate Investment Trust that operates $4.5B worth of properties/assets that has a current market cap of $2.47B, I'm no financial wizard - I'm basing future outlook on under-evaluation, lower than reasonable interest (growing), the basis of their growth in America, and current investors who've bought in the last quarter.\\n\\nBackground: AHR IPO'd early February 2024 - at a share price of $12/sh which quickly moved to $13.5\\\\~ increasing steadily both in volume and share price to $19 today. Besides the fact that they've beat revenue estimates the only 2/3 quarters they've been public . . .\\n\\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ahr/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ahr/earnings)\\n\\nTLDR;\\n\\n1. federal rate cuts in the next year or so propel REIT's forward most likely\\n2. senior living is peaking, AHR specializes in nursing homes, senior care etc.\\n3. mostly, there has been very low volume recently but continued steady growth with revenue estimates beating the first two quarter, Vanguard recently purchased \\\\~1% ownership last month, other funds following suite slowly.\\n4. the current assets value surpass the market cap valuation by almost 2x,\\n\\n**1. Federal Interest rate cut history and effects on REIT's**\\n\\n[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/)\\n\\nFederal interest rate cuts come in waves historically for stretches of at least 2 years at a time, with quarterly cuts of interest rate percentage ranging from 0.25%-1% a quarter.\\n\\nMar 22' -> July 23': 0.25% up to 5.50%\\n\\nAug 18' -> Mar 20': 2.25% down to 0%\\n\\nDec 15' -> Dec 18': . 0.25% up to 2.50%\\n\\nNow - current market consensus point to at least 3 cuts by December. Historically fed rate cuts have assisted in the stock price and performance of REIT's but obviously that doesn't just apply to REIT's - spending in general will increase with decreased interest and that would only grow - there is more depth to this but looking in the big picture - I take these points with probabilities along with the following but if you look into the many positive factors:\\n\\n- Transactional volume returns\\n\\n- cost of capital reduction\\n\\n- expansions increased with rate reductions\\n\\n- increased investments from income investors in REITs\\n\\n**2. AHR basis of Portfolio and Increase of the average age of Americans**\\n\\n[https://www.americanhealthcarereit.com/portfolio/](https://www.americanhealthcarereit.com/portfolio/)\\n\\n[https://wealthmd.net/2023/07/13/america-is-getting-older-demographics/](https://wealthmd.net/2023/07/13/america-is-getting-older-demographics/)\\n\\n[https://usafacts.org/articles/how-have-us-fertility-and-birth-rates-changed-over-time/](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-have-us-fertility-and-birth-rates-changed-over-time/)\\n\\nAHR specializes in senior housing, nursing facilities, and senior health campuses. In the last decade the average American's age has gone from 37.2 years old to 38.9 with most recent census in 2022 - with the lowest fertility rate ever recorded in 2023, the most recent years couple deciding to not have children or waiting too long more than ever - the average age of the population will keep pushing upward, granted these effects will take a while to take effect but it has been a trend that has continued.\\n\\n**3. Low but steadily increasing volume and share price**\\n\\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ahr-sec-filing-2024-08-13/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ahr-sec-filing-2024-08-13/)\\n\\nLooking at the current volume and share price historical charts - AHR has slowly grown and garnered more interest but with shockingly low volume for daily trading. Recently Vanguard has bought almost 1% of the company's shares along with other hedge funds getting a taste. This is just some confidence to instill but my last point -\\n\\n4.\\xa0**AHR's current assets are much greater than their current market cap evaluation**\\n\\n|| || |**TICKER**|**Market Cap**|**Total Assets**| |**AHR**|**2.47B**|**4.7B**| |WELL|70.363B|45.53B| |VTR|24.064B|24.673B| |DOC|15.007B|15.699B| |OHI|9.951B|8.85B| |CTRE|4.289B|2.34B|\\n\\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/sectors/real-estate/reit-healthcare-facilities/](https://finance.yahoo.com/sectors/real-estate/reit-healthcare-facilities/)\\n\\nLooking at some of the top REIT's I could find from the top - no REIT is as undervalued in comparison to their assets as AHR is. Quickly compiling the first 5 top REIT's I could find - looking at their currently held assets, they are either evaluted more or around the same as their combined assets and this varies due to how much revenue they are able to turn and how much debt they may have but with AHR - by no means should a real estate trust be valued lower than the value of their actual assets.\\n\\nMind you - I compiled this information in under 2 days. I'm here pass to pass these ideas through some bigger brains I feel like this is reasonable outlook for a long term investment but I'm looking for the counter-arguments.\",\n",

These differences contribute significantly to the variations in housing prices, urban density, and housing policies in the two countries. Below are some key aspects:\\n\\n**Key Features of Japanese Zoning and Building Codes**\\n\\n1. **Flexible Zoning Regulations**:\\n   * **Mixed-Use Zoning**: Japanese cities often have mixed-use zoning, which allows for a greater diversity of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings within the same area. This flexibility leads to more efficient land use and higher density development.\\n   * **Land Use Categories**: Japan has 12 zoning categories, ranging from exclusively residential to mixed-use and industrial, with broad permissions for various uses within each category. This contrasts with the more rigid, single-use zoning in many U.S. cities.\\n2. **Efficient Building Codes**:\\n   * **Fewer Restrictions on Building Heights**: Japan\\'s building codes generally allow for taller buildings in residential areas, provided certain criteria (like sunlight access for neighboring buildings) are met. This enables higher-density living and more efficient land use.\\n   * **Simplified Approval Process**: Japan’s building approval process is often faster and less bureaucratic than in the U.S., which can reduce construction costs and lead times.\\n3. **Property Rights and Land Use**:\\n   * **Strong Property Rights with Flexibility**: Japanese property owners have strong rights to develop their land as they see fit, within the flexible zoning laws. This contrasts with more restrictive land-use controls in the U.S., where community opposition (NIMBYism) can often block new developments.\\n4. **Government Policies Encouraging Development**:\\n   * **Urban Planning Encourages Development**: Japanese urban planning policies often encourage rather than restrict development, leading to more housing supply. This contrasts with many U.S. cities where restrictive zoning and building codes contribute to housing shortages and high prices.\\n\\n**Key Differences with U.S. Zoning and Building Codes**\\n\\n1. **Strict Zoning Regulations**:\\n   * **Single-Use Zoning**: U.S. zoning laws often strictly separate residential, commercial, and industrial uses, leading to urban sprawl, inefficient land use, and a shortage of housing in desirable areas.\\n   * **Downzoning**: U.S. cities frequently \"downzone\" areas to reduce the allowed density, leading to a scarcity of housing and driving up prices.\\n2. **Restrictive Building Codes**:\\n   * **Height and Density Limits**: Many U.S. cities have strict height limits and density restrictions (e.g., FAR or Floor Area Ratio limits), which reduce the amount of housing that can be built, especially in central areas.\\n   * **Complex Approval Processes**: U.S. building approval processes can be lengthy and complex, involving multiple agencies and public hearings, which can delay projects and increase costs.\\n3. **Community Opposition**:\\n   * **NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard)**: Community opposition to new developments is a significant barrier in the U.S., where local residents can often block or delay projects through legal challenges or political pressure.\\n4. **Infrastructure and Public Services**:\\n   * **Infrastructure-Driven Development**: In the U.S., development is often tied to the availability of infrastructure and public services, which can be a limiting factor, whereas Japan tends to integrate infrastructure planning more closely with land use.\\n\\n**Adaptation Strategy for U.S. Zip Codes**\\n\\n1. **Implement Mixed-Use Zoning**: Encourage or mandate mixed-use zoning in urban areas to promote higher density and more efficient land use. This would allow for residential, commercial, and even light industrial uses within the same neighborhoods.\\n2. **Simplify Building Codes**: Reduce the complexity of building codes, particularly regarding height and density restrictions, to allow for taller buildings and greater housing density in urban areas.\\n3. **Streamline Approval Processes**: Reform the building approval process to make it quicker and less bureaucratic, reducing the time and cost associated with new construction.\\n4. **Address NIMBYism**: Implement policies that mitigate the impact of community opposition to new developments, such as by using \"as-of-right\" zoning where certain types of development are automatically permitted without the need for special approvals.\\n5. **Encourage Development**: Adopt government policies that actively encourage housing development, such as tax incentives for developers, reduced parking requirements, or upzoning in areas close to public transit.\\n6. **Integrate Infrastructure with Land Use**: Coordinate infrastructure development more closely with land use planning to ensure that new developments are well-served by public services and transportation.\\n\\nBy adopting these aspects of Japanese zoning and building codes, U.S. cities could increase housing supply, reduce prices, and create more vibrant, mixed-use neighborhoods.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nI then asked ChatGPT to draft federal legislation to incentivize states, counties, and municipalities to adopt these kinds of zoning and land-use regulations, while also preventing rent-seeking behavior by Wall Street, local, corporate, and foreign landlords.\\n\\n**Draft Federal Legislation: The Urban Flexibility, Housing Affordability, and Anti-Rent-Seeking Act**\\n\\n**Title I: Short Title and Purpose**\\n\\n**Section 101: Short Title** This Act may be cited as the \"Urban Flexibility, Housing Affordability, and Anti-Rent-Seeking Act.\"\\n\\n**Section 102: Purpose** The purpose of this Act is to incentivize states, counties, and municipalities to adopt zoning and land-use regulations that promote housing affordability, reduce urban sprawl, and enhance economic development by encouraging the adoption of flexible, mixed-use zoning practices inspired by successful models in Japan.

Everyone knows – we hear it constantly – that affordable housing is scarce. The Federal Reserve jacking mortgage rates to 7% actually made things worse. Democrats\\' have unveiled plan B – hand out whopping checks to people who are house hunting. Which will increase demand, but does nothing about the scarce supply. See link below.\\n\\n**Here\\'s why house inflation is charging ahead constantly**. America accepts 2 million (more or less) new immigrants each year. Plus we have population growth among actual citizens at about the same level. Two plus two equals 4 million. But America is only building 2 million new housing units a year. There are not enough houses for everyone. The people with money are winning. They keep buying the limited supply of homes available. Everyone else is renting (if they are lucky). Or possibly living in a tent, car, or RV while they earn $23 an hour at the Amazon warehouse. Many warehouses now allow workers to park their RVs on the lot for free, because there are zero affordable housing units in places like California and New York. Starter homes in some cities are now said to begin at $1 million !!!!\\n\\nSending more buyers out with an extra $25,000 in their pockets does ZERO to build more houses. In fact, sky high interest rates have halted a lot of new home and apartment construction. This is what is known as cognitive dissonance: beliefs which defy common sense, and even at odds with each other. Like thinking adding more nuclear weapons to our arsenal makes us safer.\\n\\n**Well, promising free down payment checks DOES make sense, if you’re trying to win an election.**\\xa0The government won\\'t actually need to put the checks in the mail until after inauguration day. If at all. Someone can decide not to do it, if basic math shows this is a budget buster.\\n\\nOr someone can just add more to the $35 trillion national debt. The jump up and down, clapping and chanting that deficits don’t matter. According to the link below, Democrats\\' just-released economic plan includes $1.7 trillion in new government handouts. This is the insanity that both parties have been doing for as long as I can remember. And which actually causes the sort of inflation which Fed Funds increases were intended to stop. But didn’t. Houses are still sky high.

       "  'title': \"Bitcoin/Crypto's Limits: Can It Ever Be Global Currency?\",\n",
       "  'selftext': \"Hello, \\n\\nI'm currently thinking a bit more about money as I’m also exploring the market. Jeff Snider is a good economist who frequently mentions that he really appreciates Bitcoin for its lack of intermediaries and its decentralized nature. However, he repeatedly emphasizes very clearly that a fixed money supply can never work. In his eyes, it's utopian. He argues that elasticity, dynamism, adaptability, reduction, and expansion of the money supply are necessary, and in the long run, you need an average increase in money supply to avoid deflationary problems and tendencies. Therefore, Bitcoin can never be a currency for two reasons. First, because of the fixed money supply, and second, because Bitcoin on-chain can only process 7 TPS, which means that you inevitably need intermediaries through additional layers.\\n\\nMy first question is: If Bitcoin really isn’t and can’t be all that, then what is it? Is it simply an asset? There is now a new Proof of Work cryptocurrency that is also completely decentralized and can scale as high as VISA or Mastercard. What is your view on such technological advancement? Can a cryptocurrency ever become the “money of the world” if it is decentralized, scalable, secure, but has an absolutely fixed, static, and unchangeable money supply? If not, what exactly is it all about?\\n\\nThe next point I find very negative is this: Gold has the purpose of remaining stable or even increasing in value during crises. Bitcoin, on the other hand, rises and falls with the stock market. Bitcoin is therefore valued like a leveraged S&P 500 product, which neither protects nor functions in economic crises, but rather falls even more sharply during a potential stock sell-off. It can’t be a store of value if a so-called store of value is much more volatile than other assets. Even the stock market as a whole (index) is much more stable and can’t just drop by 80%... Gold certainly doesn’t, which is why people trust gold even more and store their money there, especially when the stock market is cooling down, thus behaving counter-cyclically. Bitcoin, as mentioned, behaves pro-cyclically with stocks. The market, therefore, values Bitcoin and crypto more like a stock rather than a commodity... but Bitcoin is often seen as a digital commodity by many.\\n\\nThese are many questions and observations all at once, but I’m very grateful that you take the time to consider them. Thank you. Best regards.\",\n",

Q2 earnings report has been very informative on this, and helped pricing in the supply improvements and the updated revenue projections.\\n\\nI watched Harris&Biden speech yesterday where they spent a lot of time criticizing the big pharma for their pricing practices.\\n\\ntranscript: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/15/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-on-the-progress-they-are-making-to-lower-costs-for-the-american-people-largo-md/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/15/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-on-the-progress-they-are-making-to-lower-costs-for-the-american-people-largo-md/)\\n\\nThe whole thing was about communicating their track record on fighting big pharma, and committing to doubling down on this with Harris&Waltz. Seems like this is going to be a major piece of her campaign. One of the major messages was how Biden&Harris passed the legislation that allowed reducing the prices for 15 medicines starting from January 2026.\\n\\n>Biden: \"And we’re just getting started.\\xa0 Under the law I signed,\\xa0 Medicare can negotiate lower prices for another 15 drugs next year, 15 the following, and 20 after that until every drug is covered.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 That’s the law now — now.\\xa0\"\\n\\nBiden cited significant wins realized with the new law. He mentioned price of one of the drugs have dropped from 400 to 35, and other drugs had price reductions between 40-80%.\\n\\nJust last month, Biden&Sanders called out LLY and NVO specifically\\n\\n>\"If Novo Nordisk and other pharmaceutical companies refuse to substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed, we will do everything within our power to end it for them. Novo Nordisk must substantially reduce the price of Ozempic and Wegovy,\"\\n\\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biden-says-novo-nordisk-must-cut-prices-diabetes-weight-loss-drugs-2024-07-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biden-says-novo-nordisk-must-cut-prices-diabetes-weight-loss-drugs-2024-07-02/)\\n\\nSeems like Harris&Waltz has significant likelihood of winning this election, they are very committed to cutting down the pharma companies\\' margins significantly. The GLP-1 weight loss drugs have already attracted attention in this respect and Biden communicated a very strong message for reducing GLP-1 drug prices specifically.\\n\\nAll things considered, it sounds like it\\'s time to realize the LLY gains to me. But besides that I wonder if there might be a strong bear scenario for LLY&NVO, and perhaps other pharma companies in general. LLY and NVO are trading with a very high P/E which has been driven by the long term prospects of the GLP-1 drugs. If, let\\'s say, there is a risk of the federal government enforcing price caps on these drugs in a few years time i think it will bring down valuations of these companies significantly.\\n\\nI don\\'t have much experience in the pharma sector, so i am curious what do people think.\\n\\nedit: I don\\'t get all the down votes. My goal was to share this information so that people can assess their positions in light of this news. If you think the news is neutral to the stock then it\\'s neutral. If there is any risks, i hope this can give people time to react before the hedge funds fully adjust their positions.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '\\nPeople on here seem completely oblivious to whats going on in many areas of the white collar job market (software, accounting, customer support, etc).  Companies are doing the office work equivalent to what they did in the 1980s/90s/2000s with manufacturing jobs. They sent them overseas:\\n\\n*From 1998 to 2021, the U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs thanks to the growing trade deficit in manufactured goods with China, Japan, Mexico, the European Union, and other countries.*\\n\\nhttps://www.epi.org/publication/botched-policy-responses-to-globalization/#:~:text=From%201998%20to%202021%2C%20the,European%20Union%2C%20and%20other%20countries.\\n\\nTypical responses when i make this point and why they dont hold weight:\\n\\n**Offshore stuff is garbage quality! It will eventually come back to onshore**\\n-No, look at the history of manufacturing jobs moving overseas the cheaper countries. The same argument was said with Made in China good when jobs were first sent there. At first, quality of good was bad when made in these countries but over time improved to the point where now complex electronics, cars, and everything in between is now made in Asia. Companies were willing to accept this diminished quality while production ramped up since the cost savings were so great. Same exact thing is happening to software development.\\n\\n**But this only applies to lower level jobs, senior jobs are safe!**\\n-Nope, not what im seeing. At my company there are hiring senior architects, directors and alike out of India. Heard of similar for PMs, finance directors, and HR as well. Def not just junior level positions.\\n\\n**Wait until interest rates come down, things will improve!**\\n-Seriously, when have corporations ever given up significant profits via cost savings? Do you really think they will willing increase their labor costs once interests rates drop a little and make their bottom line look even worse next quarter?\\nPoint is you need to make noise and do SOMETHING or nothing will change.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"The cost of living is such that people making under 100k have to work two jobs to be able to afford a house and family, and live comfortably. People making around 100k have to have to be in a situation with a spouse who works as well, making around 100k to love comfortably. Student debt and other debts pile up, keeping a lot of folks hamstrung.\\n\\nMeanwhile the top end is making 400k+, and there are multimillionaires and billionaires who have a huge share of national assets and financial resources.\\n\\nThe cost of living is rising because the rich can afford to pay much more, so places charge more, but wages aren't growing to keep pace for those who were once considered average.\\n\\nCertain jobs just aren't viable. Teaching, law enforcement, certain associate jobs. Where in the past, salaries were high enough so that these workers could make enough to live a decent family life, it feels as though they just don't cut it now.\\n\\nIt feels like CEOs and executives are exploiting workers, squeezing as much work out of people for as little pay as they can get away with. Back in the 90s and earlier, profits were distributed much more evenly and reasonably, but today they've figured out they don't need to do that anymore.\\n\\nIt seems like the solution to this would be to safeguard against the exploitation, but the problem is that when this is proposed via taxes or wage increase proposals, the rich labels it communism and the big bad word makes the right oppose it, even the blue collar workers who would benefit from this.\\n\\nSo nothing gets fixed. The wealth gap keeps increasing, cost of living keeps rising and wages remain stagnant.\\n\\nNow I'm no expert, obviously. But what I would desperately appreciate is if someone could tell me where I'm wrong in my thinking here. I know it can't be this simple, but it's a theory I've been working with and would like to know what I'm missing.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'https://preview.redd.it/dtezis80p0jd1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=751675840dbbc38322f32b42ceed581aa6a9e577\\n\\n***Photo above***\\xa0*- \"No Mas! No Mas!\" Bristol Myers Squibb has surrendered, and agrees to cut the price of it\\'s most expensive drugs by more than half, saving patients and Medicare billions annually.*\\n\\nIf you’re like me, you\\xa0**DON’T**\\xa0need to take Eliquis. It’s a blood thinner for people at risk of stroke and heart attack. And it costs $6,000 a year. Rather, it costs Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers $6,000 a year, if you’re covered. If you’re not covered, you pay out of pocket. The Biden administration just cut the price of this drug in half. Kudos team Biden! See link below.  \\n  \\nCredit goes to some anonymous wonks in the west wing. Biden couldn’t tell you what Eliquis is, or what it does. Neither could Kamala, but I’m sure she’ll find a way to start taking credit for this in her incessant campaign advertising on TV.  \\n  \\nTV advertising for Eliquis is probably the reason it was costing $6,000 a year. Those ads were also incessant. On the evening news every night – all networks. The strategy was to scare sick people into calling their doctors and asking about Eliquis. A medicine which those doctors are already aware of. Including the outrageous price, and some lower cost alternatives. But if you call your doctor, and you’re covered by Medicare, they\\'ll prescribe it evidently.  \\n  \\nEliquis isn’t the only medicine priced high because of never-ending TV ads. The US government also took aim at Jardience, Xaralto, Imbruvica, Junivia, and Mxyzptlk (I made that last one up. Extra credit if you know where it comes from).  \\n  \\nIf you watch the CBS evening news, you see ALL of these advertised, multiple times, during the 30 minute broadcast. CBS executives might claim they have their viewers best interest at heart. But in reality, they only want to keep senior citizens alive so that their audience share doesn’t decline any further.  \\n  \\nBefore the cheers get too load for this cost savings, let’s recognize that the price WON\\'T drop until 2026. What’s wrong with making it happen in 2025? Everyone is vague on that.  \\n  \\nI’m all in favor of letting Big Pharma recover its R&D costs. Complying with FDA rules for testing can take 7 years or more. But when you see something advertised on TV all the time, there’s no research and development in the cost. That $6,000 a year was largely made up of advertising.  \\n  \\nJust like the cost of a Big Mac, Coca Cola, Cheetos, and Twixt candy. There’s no research and development involved there too. The Coke formula was invented 150 years ago, in 1880. I don’t know when all beef patties, cheese and sesame seed buns were invented. If you think your junk food – like your medicine – costs too much, you can just stop buying it.  \\n  \\nRelated news – Starbucks\\' new CEO earns $85 million a year. Remember that the next time you order a Latte at the drive thru on your way to your $55,000 a year office job.  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[~US strikes deal to cut cost of 10 drugs for Medicare users (bbc.com)~](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75n750y3zxo)',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Towards the end of May 2024, it was reported that Nelson Peltz sold all of his Disney stocks:\\n\\n> **Nelson Peltz Reportedly Sold All of His Disney Stock, Earning $1 Billion, After Losing Proxy Fight**\\n> \\n> Nelson Peltz cashed out his shares of Disney shortly after the activist investor lost his bid to win seats on the Mouse House’s board, according to a CNBC report Wednesday.\\n> \\n> Peltz sold all of his Disney stock at “close to $120 dollars a share,” making about $1 billion on the sale, CNBC reported, citing an anonymous source. That would indicate that Peltz sold the shares in the days immediately after the April 3 Disney shareholder meeting — where his bid to shake up Disney’s board was soundly defeated.\\n> \\n> A rep for Trian Partners, the hedge fund headed by Peltz, declined to comment. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n> \\n> At the April 3 virtual meeting of Disney shareholders, investors voted to reelect the current 12-member board of directors by a substantial margin over the candidates nominated by Trian — Peltz himself and ex-Disney CFO Jay Rasulo — and a smaller investment firm, Blackwells Capital.\\n> \\n> Peltz, in an appearance on CNBC April 4, had threatened to resume his activist agenda at Disney if the company and CEO Bob Iger did not keep their “promises.”\\n> \\n> “I hope this is not a redo of last year where we pulled out, gave management a chance and the stock went down,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview. He added, “Whether we stay [invested in Disney] or not, we don’t make those kinds of announcements.”\\n> \\n> Peltz’s Trian had at one time controlled 32.3 million shares of Disney, including about 30 million owned by former Marvel Entertainment head Ike Perlmutter. (Disney alleged Perlmutter harbored a longstanding personal vendetta against Iger.) At the end of 2023, Trian’s stake represented 1.8% of Disney’s outstanding shares.\\n> \\n> In his proxy fight, one of Peltz’s biggest complaints was his allegation that Disney’s board failed to do its job with CEO succession planning in not vetting former parks boss Bob Chapek, who was Iger’s personal pick to take over the job in 2020. “They all took Bob’s word, and they voted Chapek in. That’s not what the responsibility of a director is,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview last month. The board ousted Chapek in November 2022 and brought Iger back on as CEO.\\n> \\n> In an appearance earlier on CNBC on April 4, Iger reiterated that the Disney board’s top priority is the CEO succession and he said “they’re treating it with urgency.” He also said Disney’s long-term goal is to hit double-digit margins in the streaming business, which was another key point in Trian’s proxy campaign.\\n\\nhttps://variety.com/2024/biz/news/nelson-peltz-sells-all-disney-stock-proxy-fight-1236019099/\\n\\n...but here, he still has some of those stocks left:\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/significant-shake-nelson-peltzs-portfolio-035959244.html\\n\\n...although... based on this:\\n\\n> The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), reduced by 29,692,273 shares, resulting in a -91.82% decrease in shares and a -45.29% impact on the portfolio. The stock traded at an average price of $107.65 during the quarter and has returned -17.67% over the past three months and -3.93% year-to-date.\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/significant-shake-nelson-peltzs-portfolio-035959244.html\\n\\n...it doesn't look like he bought new stocks.\\n\\nWhat do you think might've happened? I didn't see much news about Peltz buying Disney stocks again even though someone like him buying Disney stocks again might've been on the news a lot more. And what do you think this means for Disney?\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:\\n\\n* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).\\n\\n* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)\\n\\nHere's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:\\n\\n* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\\n\\n* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.\\n\\n* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.\\n\\n* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.\\n\\n* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”\\n\\n* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”\\n\\n* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Dropbox (DBX) has never been a particularly good stock - but I have reason to believe that the stock might plummet significantly sometime after November of this year due to a massive decrease in revenue. I work in film/media and have used Dropbox’s unlimited storage plan for more than 6 years.  It’s been great!  I’ve paid $98/month and have around 250 TB stored on their cloud. However, Dropbox is doing away with their unlimited plan.   Last year, a rep from Dropbox called me and I was informed that I would have until November of this year (2024) to remove my data or have to pay a significantly higher price.  They are now charging per 5TB.  My new price would be over $2000/month.  Obviously this is an insane increase in price and something I won’t pay and after calling today to make sure they didn’t design some sort of retention offer, which they indeed haven’t, I have begun the process of removing all my data from their cloud and storing it locally.  So the question becomes - if thousands of people like me all jump ship and leave Dropbox, how much could this affect their revenues?   Some people with unlimited plans pay more than me - as the price is based on how many users you have on your unlimited account, so there can be other users with unlimited accounts that pay $200 or  $500 or even 1000 per month, their pricing would also likely 10x or 20xI’m picturing 50k or more $100-$500/ month plans all leaving.  I’m not a stock picker and don’t usually try to make plays based on speculative things like this - but this is a situation that has peaked my interest.  I currently hold zero positions in DBX.   But curious how others might see this playing out. ',\n",

It would cost even more, but GM is selling your driving data (as recorded on the black box) to insurance companies.*\\n\\nOops – General Motors got caught again. This time they\\'re selling the “black box” data from our cars’ computer module to insurance companies. So the insurance companies can get a heads up, and raise our rates if the box says we were speeding, or doing something else that can result in a ticket. See link below.  \\n  \\nThe government is suing GM for . . . probably an invasion of privacy. Even though GMs lawyers probably included some sort of escape clause that there is no expectation of privacy when you buy one of their vehicles. Still, we don’t want the insurance companies getting MORE excuses to raise our rates before we even get a ticket, right?  \\n  \\nThis could cost us some serious money. I already pay $140 a month. Yours might even be more. The government has our backs. Suing GM. Except when it comes to handling their OWN identity data properly  \\n  \\nSee the second link. Hackers just got EVERY social security number in America. Your social security number so secret and protected, it’s not even on your drivers license. Is it even on my passport? I don’t know. It’s on my payroll data, because it’s used to check up on me and my tax obligations. So how did hackers get our social security numbers? From a company called “National Public Data”, which is contractor for various government agencies, and supposedly held to the highest standards. They are exchanging data back and forth with courts, corporate HR offices, etc. The US government wasn’t directly at fault for the hack. NPD was. But the government has its own challenges keeping hackers out of the white house files, pentagon, electric grid, etc.  \\n  \\nHow much are the social security numbers worth, on the “dark web”? We’ll never know, apparently. The hacking group got antsy in the middle of ransom negotiations (probably involving crypto currency) and decided to simply post our SSNs for free. With our names and address histories. Which probably includes email addresses. Did the value of this data just go up even more?  \\n  \\nIdentify theft already costs Americans $29 billion a year (2022 data). Probably will go up over the next 12 months, I guess. The $29 billion is direct losses from our bank accounts etc. The cost of identity theft monitory/protection is on top of that. LifeLock charges $250 a year for their family plan. If all 100 million US families enrolled, LifeLock would score a $25 billion payday.  \\n  \\nSo here we have a cost to consumers approaching $100 billion dollars – the theft of the single most important component of our identity. If the government is doing something about this theft, it’s not in the news. However, the government IS suing General Motors for releasing our speeding records to insurers.  \\n  \\nCan we at least apply the same standards to misuse of our data? Why should the US government and other guardians of our social security data get a free pass?  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**~General Motors Violated Customers\\' Rights In \\'Unthinkable Ways\\' When It Secretly Sold Data: Texas (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/general-motors-violated-customers-rights-in-unthinkable-ways-when-it-secretly-sold-data-texas/ar-AA1oNvf3?ocid=BingNewsSerp)  \\n  \\n[**~Your Social Security Number May Have Been Compromised in This Data Breach (msn.com)~**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/your-social-security-number-may-have-been-compromised-in-this-data-breach/ar-AA1opfmA?ocid=BingNewsVerp)',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Walmart raised its forecast for the year on Thursday, as quarterly revenue grew nearly 5%, the company’s stores and website drew more visits and sales outside the grocery department improved. \\n\\nThe discounter beat Wall Street’s expectations for sales and profits.\\n\\nWalmart said it now expects sales to rise by 3.75% to 4.75% for the full year, and adjusted earnings to come in between $2.35 and $2.43 per share. It previously said it expected to be on the high end or slightly above its initial full-year guidance, which called for net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.\\n\\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company’s brighter outlook reflects strength in the first half of the year. \\n\\n“We see, among our members and customers, that they remain choiceful, discerning, value-seeking, focusing on things like essentials rather than discretionary items, but importantly, we don’t see any additional fraying of consumer health,” Rainey said.\\n\\nHe said every month of the quarter was “relatively consistent.”\\n\\nWalmart saw another promising indicator: Sales of general merchandise, such as lawn and garden supplies, were positive for the first time in 11 quarters. He said those sales were up only slightly, however. \\n\\nHere’s what the discounter reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: 67 cents adjusted vs. 65 cents expected\\n\\nRevenue: $169.34 billion vs. $168.63 billion\\n\\nWalmart’s net income dropped to $4.5 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $7.89 billion, or 97 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\nRevenue rose from $161.63 billion in the year-ago quarter. \\n\\nComparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.2% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, which topped analysts’ expectations. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.\\n\\nAt Sam’s Club, comparable sales rose 5.2%, excluding fuel, in line with analysts’ expectations.\\n\\nE-commerce sales jumped 21% globally and 22% in the U.S.\\n\\nWalmart provided the latest window into the health of American households and the outlook for the broader economy as investors and economists seek clarity.\\n\\nAs the nation’s largest retailer, Walmart is uniquely positioned to offer insights into where the consumer is spending and scrimping. The company’s reputation for value has boosted sales over the past two years, as inflation drove more higher-income shoppers to its stores and website.\\n\\nInflation has moderated and returned to historic levels, according to July data from the U.S. Department of Labor. The consumer price index, which measures prices of a broad mix of goods and services, rose 2.9% last month compared to a year earlier. That is the lowest level since March of 2021.\\n\\nYet prices are hovering much higher than pre-pandemic, frustrating and stretching consumers. A jobs report from the Labor Department early this month also raised concerns and prompted a sharp stock market selloff, as jobs growth slowed and the unemployment rate rose more than expected.\\n\\nSome companies’ earnings reports have added to worries about the economy. Home Depot on Tuesday beat quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue, but warned of slow sales in the back half of the year and consumer caution, even among its more middle- and upper-income customer base.\\n\\nShares of Walmart closed Wednesday at $68.66. So far this year, the company’s stock is up nearly 31%, outpacing the approximately 14% gains of the S&P 500.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/walmart-reports-its-earnings-before-the-bell-heres-what-to-expect.html',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'According to Reuters: \"Toyota has seen far more dramatic growth because of its dominance of the hybrid sector, bringing the automaker to the tipping point that has pushed executives to now consider an all-hybrid lineup. Hybrids accounted for just 9% of Toyota sales in 2018 but 37% as of June.\\nThe hybrid sales surge has been a key factor driving its profit and stock price to all-time highs this year.\"\\n\\nToyota will meet US emissions regulations by focusing on hybrid automobiles. They are cheaper and more practical than EVs. Growth in EV sales has slowed down, with other automotive companies reducing investment in EVs. Toyota\\'s strategy to hedge its bets is a winner.\\n\\nWhat kind of automobile is going to be your next one? ICE, EV, or hybrid, or something else?\\n\\nReference: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-bets-big-hybrid-only-models-ev-demand-slows-2024-08-15/',\n",
