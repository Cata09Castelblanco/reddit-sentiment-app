It holds a dominant\\xa098% market share\\xa0in Data Center GPUs.\\nLast fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.\\nI believe there’s a\\xa0~50% upside\\xa0in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidia’s Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to\\xa0$200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidia’s typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.\\nKey Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:\\n1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.\\n    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 years—much of it allocated to AI and GPUs.\\n    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.\\n    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3’s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.\\n2. Supply Chain Insights:\\xa0Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect\\n    * TSMC’s CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024—a ~3x increase.\\n    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.\\n    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.\\n    * AMD’s CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030\\n3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:\\n    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone.\", 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f1ywwc/still_meaningful_alpha_left_in_nvidia/', 'num_comments': 126, 'score': 117, 'upvote_ratio': 0.84, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.3182, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.8666}\n",

I DO NOT drive the hilarious looking electric Mustang Mach E. Or the mind blowingly expensive electrified F150 “Lightning” pickup. But if I did, I'd be responsible for Ford’s $5 billion operating loss on electric vehicles this year. (see link below).  \\n  \\nWait . . . it’s not actually $5 billion. It’s going to be $6.5 billion. Ford is taking a $1.5 billion write-down on the electric SUV factory they just cancelled. Ford announced earlier this month that they are “pivoting” to hybrids. I suppose the (as yet unnamed, and undesigned) 3 row hybrid SUV will compete against similar hybrids from Honda, Hyundai, Jeep, Kia, Mazda, Toyota . . . and GM, I assume you’re going to “pivot” to hybrids too, right? Well, even if legacy US automakers are late to the party, and burdened with that new $140,000 per worker UAW contract, I’m sure there will be at least a few buyers. Octogenarians are still loyal to Buick right?  \\n  \\nI want to make it clear that I actually DO intend to buy an electric car at some point. It’s just that they’re too darn expensive. Ugly as it is, I test drove the Mach-E Mustang. A few months ago, when the dealer stopped charging $2,000 over sticker to reserve one “in transit”. There are several on the lot now. I can see why the dealers were leaning into pre-orders. It’s not an attractive driving appliance. And the $55,793 sticker (as optioned) is pricey, considering I can get a similar Hyundai Ionic 5 for about $15,000 less. They’re both ugly, but if I have to drive ugly, I don’t want to get ripped off. Maybe I could put that $15,000 towards a condo down payment?  \\n  \\nFord is also “pivoting” to a 4 door mustang. Which runs on gasoline. Stop laughing. This is absolutely true. You can google it for yourself. This solves the longstanding problem that only children can get into the rear seat of a 2 door Mustang. But since Mustangs are ALL over $40,000 now, and they aren’t even lithium powered cruise missiles, why is the price so high? The asking price will probably be higher for the upcoming 4 door Mustang. And they’ll ask for a $2,000 deposit to get on the pre-order waiting list. The G-stang Quattroporte Bullet Edition, with brushed platinum cockpit trim.  \\n  \\nI don’t blame the United Auto Workers for any of this. When the president has your back, and shows up to walk the picket line with you, it can be hard to take a deep breath and ask yourself:\\xa0*$140,000 for a high school dropout, who has a screwdriver and pliers on his toolbelt? Am I really worth 3X what a new teacher with a college degree is getting?*  \\n  \\nEarth to UAW – and Ford, and GM – the end of auto manufacturing on US soil may be at hand. You guys (and ladies) have effed this up royally. I already can’t buy any American made appliances. My refrigerator is LG. They also make dishwashers, ovens, washing machines, dryers. All of LG's stuff is top rated by consumer reports. If anyone reading this post knows of a US designed, US assembled refrigerator, please clue us in.  \\n  \\nWe’ve seen this movie before, and it doesn’t have a happy ending. All our cars will be made in Asia, or India, or some other rising 3rd world location. And US dropouts whose only credentials are a certificate for completing screwdriver 101 are going to end up on welfare, or universal basic income. But at least they will have legal weed . . .  \\n  \\nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \\n  \\n[**Ford Loses $44,000 On Every EV Sells As It Switches To Hybrids (yahoo.com)**](https://autos.yahoo.com/ford-loses-44-000-every-142800440.html)\", 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1f2drnn/you_bought_a_ford_ev_congrats_you_cost_them_5/', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 0, 'upvote_ratio': 0.29, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.6776, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.8378}\n",

Tesla\\'s stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk\\'s legal battles.\\n\\n\\n\\nGerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he\\'d been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn\\'t actually work there, who doesn\\'t try to sell the cars,\" Gerber said, adding: \"We\\'ve seen sales go down, and that\\'s what\\'s happening. Sales are going down. If you\\'re expecting a great quarter, you\\'re wrong. They\\'re not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla\\'s humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, \\'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?\\' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?\" Gerber said, adding: \"The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don\\'t know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMusk\\'s leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla\\'s board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.\\n\\n  \\nSource: [businessinsider.com](http://businessinsider.com)', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2edpy/tesla_investor_ross_gerber_says_hes_been_dumping/', 'num_comments': 413, 'score': 753, 'upvote_ratio': 0.87, 'sentiment_title_vader': -0.5423, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.9348}\n",

      "{'id': '1f2gm4q', 'created_utc': 1724764049, 'subreddit': 'stocks', 'author_name': 'ClimateChangeC', 'title': 'Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) Navigating the Evolving COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape with a Diversified Pipeline', 'selftext': '**Overview**\\n\\nModerna, a pioneering biotechnology company, has transformed from a research-stage enterprise into a commercial powerhouse with a diverse clinical portfolio spanning infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company’s first commercial product, the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax®, has already impacted hundreds of millions of lives globally. However, Moderna’s story extends far beyond its COVID-19 success, as it continues to leverage its mRNA platform to advance a robust pipeline of 40 development candidates across 47 programs, 43 of which are currently in clinical studies.\\n\\n**Financials**\\n\\nIn the fiscal year 2023, Moderna reported annual revenue of $6,754 million and a net loss of $4,714 million. The company’s annual operating cash flow was negative $3,118 million, and its annual free cash flow was negative $3,825 million. These financial results reflect the significant investments Moderna is making to advance its diverse pipeline and build out its global commercial, regulatory, sales, and manufacturing infrastructure.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Moderna reported net product sales of $167 million, a significant decline from the $1,828 million reported in the same period of the prior year. This decrease is indicative of the evolving nature of the endemic COVID-19 vaccine market, which has transitioned toward a more seasonal commercial pattern. The company expects this trend to persist, resulting in further projected reductions in net product sales for its COVID-19 vaccine relative to 2023.\\n\\n**Business Overview**\\n\\nDespite the decline in COVID-19 vaccine sales, Moderna remains focused on its long-term strategy of diversifying its revenue streams and advancing its robust pipeline. The company’s COVID-19 vaccine strategy for 2024 is centered on working with public health officials, healthcare providers, and pharmacies to increase vaccination coverage rates, particularly in the United States. In Europe, Moderna is actively participating in the 2024 tender process, which allows for up to 36 million doses per year for up to 4 years. In the Rest of the World, the company has reoriented its commercial teams to prioritize markets for greater commercial focus and impact, as evidenced by the recent contract with Brazil for 4.5 million doses.\\n\\n**Pipeline Progress**\\n\\nModerna’s pipeline progress extends well beyond its COVID-19 vaccine. The company is eagerly awaiting the approval of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, which is expected to launch into a large market. In its first year, the older adult RSV market was $2.5 billion in sales, and analysts expect the older adults’ market to grow between $6 billion and $8 billion per year. Moderna’s RSV vaccine has a strong efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials and will be the only product available in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation, which the company believes will ease the burden on pharmacies during the fall respiratory season.\\n\\nIn addition to its respiratory vaccine portfolio, Moderna is making significant strides in its latent virus vaccines, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The company’s CMV vaccine, mRNA-1647, has fully enrolled its Phase III trial, and Moderna is anticipating potential for Phase III efficacy data in 2024. The EBV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1189, has shown positive Phase I immunogenicity and safety data, and Moderna is now advancing towards pivotal trials.\\n\\nModerna’s individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) program, developed in collaboration with Merck, continues to demonstrate promising results. The partners have initiated three new randomized clinical studies in additional tumor types in 2024, including a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma, a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and a Phase 2/3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\n**Liquidity**\\n\\nThe company’s financial position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling approximately $12.2 billion as of March 31, 2024. This robust balance sheet enables Moderna to continue investing in its pipeline and commercial operations. In March 2024, the company entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement with Blackstone Life Sciences, which will provide up to $750 million in funding to support the advancement of Moderna’s investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccine program.\\n\\nModerna’s commitment to financial discipline is evident in its operating expense management. During the first quarter of 2024, the company’s total operating expenses decreased by almost $800 million compared to the same period in 2023. This reduction was driven by lower spending in manufacturing, development, and selling, general, and administrative functions.\\n\\n**Outlook**\\n\\nLooking ahead, Moderna expects net sales for 2024 to be approximately $4 billion, which the company believes will be a low point as it expects to return to growth in 2025. The company anticipates cost of sales to be approximately 35% of product sales for the full year, down from 70% in 2023, reflecting improvements in manufacturing efficiency and expected reductions in inventory write-downs.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nModerna’s diversified pipeline, strong financial position, and focus on operational efficiency position the company well to navigate the evolving COVID-19 vaccine market and continue advancing its broader therapeutic and vaccine programs. As the company continues to execute on its strategic priorities, investors will closely monitor the progress of its late-stage clinical candidates, including the RSV vaccine, CMV vaccine, and INT program, as well as the potential launch of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine programs.\\n\\nSource: [https://beyondspx.com/2024/07/30/moderna-nasdaqmrna-navigating-the-evolving-covid-19-vaccine-landscape-with-a-diversified-pipeline/](https://beyondspx.com/2024/07/30/moderna-nasdaqmrna-navigating-the-evolving-covid-19-vaccine-landscape-with-a-diversified-pipeline/)', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2gm4q/moderna_nasdaqmrna_navigating_the_evolving/', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 2, 'upvote_ratio': 0.56, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.0, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.9951}\n",

The board expanded Tan\\'s responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.\\n\\nOver time, Tan grew frustrated by the company\\'s large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel\\'s risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. \\n\\nThe circumstances around Tan\\'s exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel\\'s strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.\\n\\nTan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said.

Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel\\'s program, two sources said.\\n\\nTo cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.\\n\\nThe layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel\\'s engineering efforts.\\n\\nGelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel\\'s payroll by 2022.\\n\\nTo Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.\\n\\nTan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel\\'s server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.\\n\\nIntel\\'s workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the \"only-the-paranoid-survive\" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.\\n\\nIntel\\'s turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.\\n\\nAn attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.\\n\\nWithout Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel\\'s manufacturing business.\\n\\nTan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.\\n\\nIntel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2ji5j/intel_board_member_quit_after_differences_over/', 'num_comments': 104, 'score': 335, 'upvote_ratio': 0.97, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.0, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': -0.0624}\n",

Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramer’s high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors’ headlong rush into the American chipmaker’s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.\\n\\nGalloping sales of Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an\\xa0AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as\\xa0[the world’s most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that title—and $900bn in value—amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. “How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?” Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his\\xa0CNBC\\xa0show last week, referring to Nvidia’s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, “Not an\\xa0*Ursus nvidiaensis*\\xa0in sight.”\\n\\nFor every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the\\xa0S&P\\xa0500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson’s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of\\xa0*The Economist*’s parent company.)\\n\\nInvestment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and\\xa0UBS\\xa0project that Nvidia’s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn—a third more than Apple, tech’s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia’s long-term growth story.\\n\\nThe first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia\\xa0[designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market)\\xa0but does not produce them. That falls to\\xa0[TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into\\xa0AI\\xa0servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of\\xa0TSMC’s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed “customer\\xa0B”, one of two that represent at least 10% of\\xa0TSMC’s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with\\xa0TSMC\\xa0last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia’s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with\\xa0TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current “customer\\xa0A”, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.\\n\\nEven as Nvidia’s and\\xa0TSMC’s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved\\xa0AI\\xa0chip every year, rather than every couple of years.\\xa0TSMC\\xa0is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia’s accelerated timeline fits in with\\xa0TSMC’s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.\\n\\nNvidia’s reliance on\\xa0TSMC\\xa0also highlights the second tension in the bulls’ case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors’ bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.\\n\\nIn August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had “heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance”. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla.\\xa0[AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no\\xa0AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy\\xa0ZT\\xa0Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia’s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia’s market share what Chinese competitors like\\xa0BYD\\xa0did to Tesla’s in electric cars.\\n\\n# Exit pursued by a bear\\n\\nAssuming a killer app eventually emerges—which it hasn’t yet—generative\\xa0ai\\xa0is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT\\xa0query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for\\xa0*U. nvidiaensis*\\xa0to resist.\\xa0■', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2momw/what_could_stop_the_nvdia_frenzy/', 'num_comments': 20, 'score': 0, 'upvote_ratio': 0.43, 'sentiment_title_vader': -0.5423, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.9913}\n",

It anticipates sales will be in a range of a 1% decline to 1% growth from the prior year, compared to previous guidance of down 2% to up 1%. \\n\\nShares rose more than 10% in extended trading.\\n\\nHere’s how the department store did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: 96 cents adjusted vs. 71 cents expected\\n\\nRevenue: $3.89 billion vs. $3.90 billion expected\\n\\nThe company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 3 was $122 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $137 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to supply chain impairments, the retailer posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share. \\n\\nSales rose to $3.89 billion, up about 3.4% from $3.77 billion a year earlier. Revenue came in just shy of analysts’ expectations. \\n\\nAs consumers continue to pull back on discretionary spending in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, retailers have been working to improve operations and cut costs to protect profits against softening demand. \\n\\nDuring the quarter, Nordstrom’s profits fell compared to the same period a year ago, but earnings grew over the last six months. Last year, Nordstrom reported a net loss of $67 million in the six months ended July 29, 2023, but in the same period this year, it posted a profit of $83 million. \\n\\nNordstrom has said it is working to improve its supply chain. Last quarter, it said that the time it takes for online orders to arrive was over 5% faster. It’s also improved the way merchandise is making its way to customers and stores, which it said has helped drive higher conversion and lower return rates. \\n\\nAnother key focus area for the company has been growing its off-price banner, Nordstrom Rack. Over the last couple of quarters, momentum has been growing at Nordstrom Rack and has helped prop up the company’s overall results. During the quarter, sales at Nordstrom Rack were up 8.8%, while comparable sales increased 4.1% compared to the same period a year ago.\\n\\nThat compares to Nordstrom’s mainline banner, which saw net sales and comparable sales each increase by just 0.9%. \\n\\nNordstrom has been working to build more Rack locations and has opened 11 new locations so far this fiscal year, with a goal of opening at least 22 by the end of the year. \\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/27/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q2-2024.html', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2r08n/nordstrom_shares_jump_10_as_earnings_top/', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'upvote_ratio': 0.73, 'sentiment_title_vader': 0.1027, 'sentiment_selftext_vader': 0.9822}\n",
